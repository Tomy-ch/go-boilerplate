# Domain Layer (`internal/domain`) Guide

## Role in Onion Architecture

- The **core of the business**. It represents **essential rules** such as entities, value objects, domain services, and domain events.
- It has no concern for external systems (HTTP / DB / UI) and defines behavior using **pure models and language**.
- The most resilient layer to change. It is protected under the assumption that **as long as this layer does not break, the product remains maintainable**.

## Role in this project

- Place **Entity / ValueObject / Repository (IF)** under `internal/domain/<aggregate>/`. A
  **Domain Service** does *not* belong here: it exists because the operation is the natural
  responsibility of no entity and no value object, so no aggregate package owns it — see
  [Where a Domain Service lives](#where-a-domain-service-lives).

One package per aggregate, named after it, holding these files:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Root["Aggregate: &lt;name&gt;"]
    A["&lt;name&gt;_domain.go (Aggregate Root)"]
    B["value.go (ValueObject)"]
    D["&lt;name&gt;_repository.go (Repository IF)"]
    E["error.go (Domain Error)"]
    F["constant.go (Validation Const)"]

    Root --> A
    Root --> B
    Root --> D
    Root --> E
    Root --> F
```

- As a principle, describe rules using **functions without side effects (pure functions)**.  
  I/O, time retrieval, and random generation should depend on **values injected via arguments**.

- **No `context.Context` in domain logic.** A Repository interface signature may declare one, because
  the seam it describes is crossed by an implementation that needs it for propagation. Nothing else
  here takes one: a rule that accepts a deadline or a cancellation signal is a rule that expects to
  perform I/O, and this layer performs none. Note that depguard cannot catch this — `context` is a
  standard-library package that outer layers legitimately use, so the rule holds by review rather than
  by lint.

- State changes must be performed through **entity methods**, and must not access external resources.

- Types should follow an **effectively immutable** approach.

  - private field + getter
  - defensive copy (`ptr.Copy`)
  - setters are prohibited
  - state changes occur through **behavior methods**

- Dependencies should be **injected via constructors**.

- External libraries must not be imported directly; they should be used **through pkg wrappers**.

Examples:

- UUID → `pkg/uuid`
- Decimal → `pkg/decimal`
- Error → `pkg/xerrors`

- A domain package must **not** import another aggregate (enforced by depguard: `internal/domain/`
  is denied). Business-semantic value objects used by more than one aggregate, which cannot live in
  `pkg/` because `pkg/` forbids business logic, live in the **domain lexicon**
  [`internal/domain/lexicon`](lexicon/README.md), which every domain package may import. Placement is
  resolved `pkg/` first, and admission is deliberately narrow — the name states the question asked at
  the door: is this a word of the business? See its README.
  Rationale: [ADR-0038 (domain-lexicon)](../../docs/adr/0038-domain-lexicon.md).

  The other path that may import an aggregate is `internal/domain/service/**`, where every Domain
  Service lives; it has its own depguard rule that repeats every other domain deny. The rule permits
  the extra edge and never requires it, so a service that speaks of one aggregate lives there too. See
  [Where a Domain Service lives](#where-a-domain-service-lives).

## Domain boundaries

The Domain layer is a layer that **expresses business rules and state transitions**.

Domain responsibilities:

- Invariants
- State transitions
- Value consistency
- Business rules

What Domain is not responsible for:

- Search specifications
- DB optimization
- SQL structure
- External API calls
- Aggregation processing

These are handled in the following layers:

- Usecase
- QueryService
- ReadModel

Repository provides **only persistence abstraction**.

Simple queries are acceptable in practice.

Allowed examples:

- `FindByXXX`
- `FindByActive`
- `CountByXXX`

## Entity or Value Object

Before deciding how to implement a domain type, decide **what it is**. The two kinds are separated by
one question, and it is not "does it deserve invariants" — every domain type deserves those.

**An Entity has an identity that outlives its attributes.** Change every field of a user and it is
still the same user; that continuity is what an identity is for. Two entities are the same when their
identities match, whatever their attributes say.

**A Value Object has no identity.** It is the value it holds, so two of them are the same exactly when
their contents are equal. Nothing about it persists across a change, because changing it produces a
different value rather than the same thing in a new state. Replace it whole; never mutate it in place.

Deciding for a new type:

1. Ask whether the thing needs to be traceable as *the same one* over time — through updates,
   through persistence, through being handed around. If yes, it is an Entity and it needs an identity
   field that never changes.
2. If it does not, it is a Value Object. Give it equality by content and make it immutable.
3. If the answer depends on the context — an address is an Entity to a delivery service and a Value
   Object to a customer record — the answer is the one that holds *in this model*, not in general.

### How far Value Objects go here

Evans models an attribute as a Value Object wherever the attribute carries meaning of its own. **This
repository does not go that far**: an attribute is wrapped only when it has an invariant worth
enforcing (a non-negative price, a bounded string), and stays a primitive otherwise.

This is a deliberate departure. Wrapping every attribute buys type-level protection against
mixing up two same-typed fields, but it multiplies the type count and the conversion noise at every
boundary, and the protection it adds over a well-named field with a validated constructor is small.
The cost outruns the benefit at this size. Where the swap risk is real — same-typed adjacent
parameters — the remedy this repository uses is bundling into an attribute struct instead; see the
struct-bundling section below.

**When a value carries business meaning, give the domain the question, not the type.** Callers rarely
want the value; they want to know whether something is in a state — published, low on stock, still
active, able to move to the next status. Put that predicate on whatever owns the value and let the
representation stay inside. The caller then reads in the language of the model, and the value is free
to change shape without touching anything that asks about it.

These are two separate tests, and a value can pass either, both, or neither. Wrapping asks whether the
value has an invariant to enforce at construction; a predicate asks whether anything decides on it. A
status passes both — it rejects codes it does not know, and it owns the questions others ask — so it is
a type. An opaque identifier passes neither, and stays a primitive with nothing attached. The common
mistake is to read "this value carries meaning" as a reason to wrap it: meaning is carried by the
question, and a wrapper with no invariant and no caller is a name and a conversion.

**`pkg/` does not contain Value Objects in this sense.** Types there wrap a vendor library or a
primitive without carrying business meaning, which is exactly what disqualifies them from this layer;
see [`pkg/README.md`](../../pkg/README.md).

## Domain events

A transition that the outside world needs to hear about **returns the fact it produced**:

```go
func (e *Entity) Cancel(now time.Time) (Event, error)
```

The aggregate that underwent the change is the only thing that knows it happened, so the aggregate
is what declares it. Returning the event from the transition means the compiler ties the two
together: a caller cannot obtain the event without the transition having succeeded, and cannot
succeed at the transition without being handed the event. "State changed but no event was emitted"
and "an event was emitted but nothing changed" stop being writable.

An event is a **fact**, so it is past-tense, immutable, and carries the time it occurred — the same
instant the transition recorded, not a second reading of the clock.

**The name is domain vocabulary; the wire format is not.** What the event is called (`canceled`,
`shipped`) belongs here. The versioned type string, the JSON field names, and the payload shape are
a transport contract owned by the layer that publishes it — this layer holds no serialization. A
mapping in that layer turns a domain event into its published form, which is also where a version
rises when the payload changes shape while the fact stays the same.

Collecting events on the aggregate to be drained after save (pending events) is **not** used here.
Returning them from the transition gets the same guarantee without giving the aggregate mutable
state to manage.

## Implementation notes

### Naming / structure

- Struct names should be **domain names**
- Slice types may be defined when necessary

```go
type Users []*User
```

- Repository interface name should be `Repository`
- Package name should be the domain name
- Constructor name should be `New`

> **Departure from Evans.** For Evans a Module is part of the model: the dividing lines and the names
> are meant to carry an insight about the domain, and the structure is expected to evolve as the model
> does. The rules above are mechanical beside that — they say what to call things, not what a division
> should reveal. The gap is deliberate: the lines drawn here are the ones the architecture implies, and
> a line that expresses a model is drawn by whoever holds the model. Where a real domain is present,
> read the mechanical rules as the floor and add the model-revealing divisions on top.
> While this repository is distributed as a boilerplate, why it stops at the floor is an upstream-only reason recorded in [`docs/get-started/boilerplate-only-conventions.md`](../../docs/get-started/boilerplate-only-conventions.md). <!-- boilerplate-only:line -->

### Bundle attributes into a struct when positional arguments can be swapped

The criteria — when a same-typed-parameter swap is a real risk, when it is not, and whether to remedy it
with distinct VO types or with a struct — are layer-independent and live in `docs/rules.md`
("Function Signature Rules"). This section covers only how the domain layer applies them.

An entity whose attributes trigger the rule bundles them into a value struct shared by every entry point,
so creation, reconstruction, and update cannot drift apart:

```go
// The attribute set shared by the constructor and the behavior methods.
type Attributes struct {
    Name        string
    Description *string
    // ...
    ImagePath   *string
}

func New(id uuid.UUID, attrs Attributes) (*Entity, error)
func Reconstruct(id uuid.UUID, attrs Attributes, version int) (*Entity, error)
func (e *Entity) Update(attrs Attributes) error
```

The identity (`id`) and the optimistic-lock version stay positional — they are distinctly typed and are
not part of the attribute set the update entry point replaces. When only a subset of the attributes is
replaceable, name that subset as its own struct and embed it (`user.Profile` inside `user.Attributes`)
rather than declaring two overlapping structs.

Reconstruction from a DB row is the most exposed caller in this layer, so the mapping test the rule
requires belongs on the Repository's row-to-entity conversion as well as on the constructor.

### Do not set outside constructor

- Invariants are guaranteed in `New(...)`
- setters are prohibited
- state changes occur through **behavior methods**

`Reconstruct(...)` runs the same invariants as `New(...)`. There is no relaxed path for data that is
already stored.

**An aggregate is constructed whole, children included.** One call produces the root and the parts it
owns, and that call is where the invariants are checked — including the ones no part can judge alone,
such as uniqueness across siblings or a total that has to agree with the lines it sums. A child's own
constructor assembles a part; it is not the gate. Giving it one would split a single rule across two
places and leave the cross-child half with nowhere to live. `Reconstruct(...)` is bound by this too:
the children arrive already assembled from storage, so the root is the only point at which the set
can still be rejected.

> **Departure from Evans.** Evans warns that reconstituting an object from storage is not the same
> problem as creating one: the data already exists, so a violated invariant may call for a repair
> strategy rather than a flat refusal. This model always fails hard — a row that breaks an invariant
> surfaces as an error at load time. A stored violation is a defect to be found, and repairing it
> silently would hide that defect at the exact moment it becomes observable. The cost is accepted:
> such a row blocks reads of that aggregate until it is corrected.

### The constructor is the Factory

`New(...)` and `Reconstruct(...)` are this model's Factory, and there is no separate Factory type.
A Factory exists to take the knowledge of how to assemble a valid whole away from the client and give
it to something that owns it; a constructor in the aggregate's own package does that already. The
client supplies values, the constructor decides what counts as valid, and a half-built instance is
never observable. Reconstitution's Factory is the Repository — it reads the row and hands it to
`Reconstruct(...)`, which is why no outer layer assembles an aggregate field by field.

**A Factory type appears when construction acquires configuration** — something fixed across
creations, such as a numbering scheme or a rule that varies by tenant. The type holds that
configuration and its method takes the per-creation data. Data that changes every call is an argument,
not a field; when nothing is left to hold, the type has no reason to exist and `New(...)` is already
the whole pattern.

**Construction takes values, never injected collaborators.** Do not give the domain a generator or a
policy interface to build with. A generator makes the domain perform an effect, so the same inputs
stop producing the same aggregate. A policy interface is worse: it moves the very rule the constructor
exists to state back outside the domain and leaves only its name behind — the criterion is then
authored where it cannot be seen (see § Query and Aggregate for the same failure in a query path).
Outer layers run the effects — identifiers, clocks — and pass in the results, exactly as behavior
methods already take `now`. If a choice must be configurable, pass the choice as a domain value and
keep the branching in the domain.

**Variation is data by default; types are the exception.** The other reason to reach for a Factory is
to choose which concrete type to build, and that presumes a model with several. Business domains do
carry real variety, so the question is where to put it, not whether it exists. Put it in a value the
domain interprets — a status code, a period kind — and keep one type whose behavior switches on that
value. Move the distinction into separate types only when the variants differ in their **fields and
invariants**, not merely in behavior: the signal is a single struct accumulating fields that are
meaningless for half of its instances, each guarded by a check that some other field is set.

Moving early costs twice here. Reconstitution then has to pick the type from a discriminator column,
which drags that choice — and the schema it reads — into the domain, the one place that is supposed to
know nothing about storage. And the static exhaustiveness checks that cover a switch over values do
not cover a switch over implementations, so the compiler stops telling you where to go when a variant
is added. Keeping variation as data keeps both properties.

### Access via getter

- Fields must not be exported

```go
ID()
FirstName()
Email()
```

- pointer types must use **defensive copy**

```go
ptr.Copy(...)
```

### Do not add tags to struct

Domain must not know the outside world.

Forbidden:

```text
json
db
validate
```

These belong to DTO / Infrastructure.

### Not every DB column is an entity field

An entity models only state that carries **domain meaning**. Columns that exist purely for persistence or search infrastructure are intentionally left off the entity, even when present in the table:

- Audit columns (`created_at` / `updated_at`) — read them directly from the DB when needed; they need not become entity fields or invariants.
- DB-generated / computed columns (e.g. `GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED` search-text columns) — infrastructure search optimization, not domain state.

So a 1:1 entity ↔ column correspondence is **not** required; absence of such columns from an entity is a deliberate design choice, not drift.

### Handling time and ID

- Do not use `time.Now()` in Domain
- Do not generate UUID in Domain

Generation must be done in:

- Controller
- Usecase

Domain receives only **typed values**

```go
uuid.UUID
time.Time
```

### Validation

#### Format check

Principle: **Value Objects**

Example:

```go
NewEmail(...)
```

Primitive types may be allowed in lightweight domains.

#### Boundary value check

Boundary values are defined in `constant.go`

```go
minLength
maxEmailLength
```

#### Why validate here when OpenAPI already validates the request?

The OpenAPI request-validation middleware and this layer are **not redundant** — they have different owners and different scopes:

- **Different owner.** OpenAPI constraints are the *wire contract* (what the HTTP API accepts); the domain constants are the *business rule* (what the business considers valid). They may legitimately differ — see [Input Boundary Value Ownership](../../openapi/boundary-ownership.md).
- **The only universal chokepoint — both inbound and from persistence.** Every entity is built through `New(...)`. Not only do non-HTTP write paths (seed, CLI, batch jobs, tests, any future entrypoint) bypass the request middleware entirely — reconstruction from the database goes through the same validating constructor, because the Repository rebuilds every row through it rather than assigning fields directly. So `New(...)` also guards against invalid data coming *from* infra: a corrupt, manually-inserted, or legacy row that violates a domain invariant fails at reconstruction instead of surfacing as a valid-looking entity. The middleware cannot protect this read path at all; only the domain can.
- **Framework-agnostic self-protection.** The domain must be correct independent of its caller. Delegating validation to the transport layer would couple the domain's correctness to Echo / the middleware, violating the layer's framework-agnostic rule.

In short: the middleware protects the HTTP boundary; the domain protects the *business rule itself*, for all callers.

#### Errors

Errors must be **specific errors**

```go
ErrInvalidEmail
ErrInvalidPostalCode
```

Do not return abstract errors directly.

```go
if ok, msg := stringkit.ValidateInRange(email, minLength, maxEmailLength); !ok {
    return nil, xerrors.Wrap(ErrInvalidEmail, msg)
}
```

For **user-correctable input fields**, do not stop at the first failure: validate all
fields, join the per-field errors, and attach the invalid field identifiers via
`apperror.WithDetails` so the API can report every invalid field at once
(see the Error Metadata section of [`internal/apperror/README.md`](../apperror/README.md)):

```go
errs = append(errs, xerrors.Wrap(ErrInvalidEmail, msg))
fields = append(fields, FieldEmail) // constant matching the API property name
...
return apperror.WithDetails(xerrors.Join(errs...), fields...)
```

The field identifiers are domain constants (`FieldEmail = "email"`) matching the API
request property names; the reason text stays in the wrapped error message (log-only).
Server-internal invariants (id, timestamps) keep first-error return —
they are not user-correctable input.

### Invariants (Domain Invariant)

Entities must **always satisfy invariants**.

Examples:

- `updatedAt >= createdAt`
- `deletedAt >= createdAt`
- `deletedAt >= updatedAt`

Invariant enforcement points:

- `New(...)`
- state transition methods

Usecase / Repository  
**do not have responsibility to enforce invariants**.

## Aggregate Design

In this project, **Aggregate is the design unit**.

```text
internal/domain/<aggregate>/
```

### Aggregate Root

Each Aggregate has **one Root**.

Responsibilities:

- consistency guarantee
- external operation entry point
- persistence target

```go
type User struct {
    id uuid.UUID
}
```

Repository is defined **for the Root**

```go
type Repository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
}
```

### Aggregate consistency

Changes must go **through the Root only**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Usecase --> Root["Aggregate Root"] --> Entity
```

### Aggregate Boundary

Keep Aggregate **small**

Principle (the default, not an absolute — see the two departures below):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Rule["1 Aggregate = 1 Transaction Boundary"]
```

Avoid:

- large aggregates
- direct DB structure mapping
- tightly coupled models

**Two named situations depart from the principle**, and only these two. Both put rows belonging to
more than one aggregate inside a single transaction, and each has to be justified against its own
criterion before it is used — the criterion, and the default that precedes both, are the three
branches of [ADR-0033 (commandservice-atomicity-criterion)](../../docs/adr/0033-commandservice-atomicity-criterion.md) § Decision
procedure:

- **A guard that must not go stale** (branch 2). An operation reads another aggregate to decide
  whether it is permitted, and a concurrent write could invalidate that condition between the check
  and the commit. The guard row is locked before the condition is evaluated, and held to the commit
  ([ADR-0035 (ordered-pessimistic-row-locks)](../../docs/adr/0035-ordered-pessimistic-row-locks.md)). The other aggregate is
  observed, never mutated, and the operation stays a regular usecase.
- **A multi-aggregate write that must be atomic** (branch 3). The requirements say an intermediate
  state must never be observable, so the writes run in one transaction through a CommandService
  ([ADR-0031 (lightweight-cqrs)](../../docs/adr/0031-lightweight-cqrs.md)).

Everything else decomposes: a single-aggregate write plus an eventually consistent cascade, which is
the branch this principle describes without exception.

### Cross-aggregate reference

References must be **ID only**

```go
type Order struct {
    userID uuid.UUID
}
```

Forbidden:

```text
Order {
    user *User
}
```

**This rule governs the seam between one aggregate and another — nothing else.** What decides which
side of that seam a type sits on is whether it has an access path of its own: a type reachable only
through its parent is a sub-entity of that aggregate, while a type that is queried, listed, or
maintained on its own is a separate aggregate however its package is nested.

A sub-entity is inseparable from its parent, so this rule does not reach it: it holds its own
attributes directly. Whether it exposes its own identity is a design decision, not a consequence of
this rule — exposing it is usually right, because a caller sometimes needs the identity and because
the alternative invites a back-reference to the parent, which becomes indistinguishable from the
sub-entity's own fields. **Never give a sub-entity a back-reference to its parent.**

**Exception — reference master.** A reference master may be held as its identity plus whatever
attributes are needed to present it, rather than as a bare identity. Those attributes are a
denormalized copy carried for presentation: the value exposes none of the other aggregate's behavior
and is never read to reach a decision. A mutable aggregate stays identity-only.

> **Departure from Evans.** Evans permits an aggregate to hold a direct reference to another
> aggregate's root, trusting that root to guard its own invariants. This model does not: a mutable
> aggregate is reachable by identity only. A direct reference makes it too easy to load a graph and
> mutate through it, collapsing two transaction boundaries into one by accident; refusing it costs a
> lookup and buys a boundary the compiler can see. The reference-master exception above is the single
> place a non-identity value crosses, and it carries no behavior to mutate through.

### Reference master aggregates

A reference master is a lighter archetype than a mutable aggregate: no state-transition method, no
optimistic-lock version, no audit timestamps, no logical deletion, and a Repository that exposes
lookups only, with no write operation. Do not add those to make one resemble the others — **their
absence is the contract that says the application does not write this data.**

Reference masters exist for two distinct reasons; do not conflate them.

- **A copy of a distinction that exists outside the application** — a standard, a statute. Its value
  set is not decided by the business, so it does not grow or shrink with a business decision.
- **A vocabulary the business defines** — a classification, a status. The business itself decides the
  value set, so a change to it *is* a business decision. These are often placed as a dimension
  subordinate to the aggregate that references them.

**A lookups-only Repository does not by itself make a reference master.** The test is whether the
data is part of the owning aggregate's semantic set — no independent transactional lifecycle, and
reached through a mandatory, uniquely-determined foreign key. A table that is standing lookup data
but is queried and listed on its own terms is an *independent aggregate*: it stays identity-only, and
its attributes are resolved by a usecase-layer batch fetch rather than carried across the seam. Being
externally given and never written by the application does not settle it either — that describes the
data's origin, not its place in another aggregate's semantic set. See
[`docs/rules.md`](../../docs/rules.md) § Repository / QueryService Rules for the read-path
consequences of the same distinction.

<!-- sample-api:begin -->
`internal/domain/prefecture` is the case to compare against — externally given and never written by
the application, yet queried and listed on its own terms, so an independent aggregate rather than a
reference master.
<!-- sample-api:end -->

### Where a rule goes

Three questions, asked in this order. **The first one that answers, decides** — a later question
never overrules an earlier one. They are not three views of one judgement; each separates a different
pair of destinations, and reading them as competing tests is what makes the placement look ambiguous
when it is not.

1. **Is the question about one thing, or about a set?** — separates an entity or value object from a
   Domain Service.
2. **Does the rule fit on one entity or value object?** — separates an entity or value object from a
   Domain Service, once question 1 admits either.
3. **Does it derive, or does it map?** — separates a Domain Service from Usecase.

#### 1. One thing or a set

**A question about one thing is the entity's; a question about a set is the Domain Service's.**

A question decided from one instance's own state is a method on that instance. A question whose
answer for any one member depends on which others are in the set has no single instance that can host
it, so it goes to a Domain Service. What separates them is how many things the question is about, not
how many aggregates it reaches.

This is why the admission bar below asks about responsibility and never about aggregate count. A bar
that required spanning aggregates would send a set-shaped rule back to an instance method that cannot
be written, or into Usecase, where [`../usecase/README.md`](../usecase/README.md) forbids it —
leaving an operation that is plainly a business rule with nowhere in the layer to go.

<!-- sample-api:begin -->
Worked pair: `Purchase.IsShippable` answers *is this purchase ready to ship*, decided from one
purchase's own state, so it is a method on `Purchase`. `dispatch.GroupForDispatch` answers *which of
these purchases may go out together*, and the answer for any one of them depends on which others are
in the set, so no single `Purchase` can host it. Both speak only of the purchase aggregate.
<!-- sample-api:end -->

#### 2. On one entity, or on none

A rule that is the natural responsibility of no entity and no value object belongs to a **Domain
Service** — not to Usecase.

<!-- sample-api:begin -->
```text
Withdrawal        ← in-progress purchase
Dispatch grouping ← purchases awaiting shipment
```
<!-- sample-api:end -->

#### 3. Derivation or mapping

Once the rule does not fit on any entity or value object, this question separates a Domain Service
from Usecase.

- **Domain Service** derives something: it computes a business-meaningful value from more than one
  entity. It is stateless, and it exists only because the operation is the natural responsibility of
  no one entity and no value object.
- **Usecase** coordinates and maps. It orders the calls, owns the transaction, and turns domain
  models into DTOs.

**Reading more than one entity is not derivation.** Loading two entities and placing them side by
side in a DTO is mapping, and it stays in Usecase. Routing that through a Domain Service would drag
every two-entity read into the domain layer for nothing.

When a value is derived and then shipped outward, the two split: the derivation is the Domain
Service's, the copying into the DTO is the Usecase's.

The test, when it is unclear: **if that calculation changed, would the reason be a business decision
or a presentation decision?** A business decision means it is a domain rule. Note what this test does
*not* decide: whether the derived value binds anything. A business judgement that is advisory —
produced for display, stale the moment it is returned, and depended on by no invariant — is still a
business judgement, and still belongs in the domain. Whether a value must stay true until commit is a
transaction-boundary question, answered by
[ADR-0033](../../docs/adr/0033-commandservice-atomicity-criterion.md), not a placement question.

#### Not reaching another aggregate is not a reason to leave the domain

The three questions above decide the placement. This is not a fourth one — it removes the
objection that most often stops the first three from being asked at all.

A rule frequently needs values that live in another aggregate: a quantity, a price, a status. Because
an aggregate package may not import another aggregate, this looks like a wall that forces the rule
outward into Usecase. **It is not.**

**The aggregate that owns the rule takes those values as a snapshot it does not keep** — a value type
declared in its own package, carrying only the attributes the rule reads, passed in by the Usecase
that loaded them. The rule stays where it belongs; only the loading moves. The aggregate still holds
no reference to the other aggregate, so its invariants remain independent of that aggregate's state.

Reach for this before concluding that a rule cannot live in the domain. Moving a business judgement
into Usecase because the values came from elsewhere puts it where
[`../usecase/README.md`](../usecase/README.md) says business rules must not be defined, and splits
one rule across two layers the first time a second caller needs it.

A snapshot is a value, not a view of a live aggregate: it is read once, passed in, and discarded. It
carries no behavior and no identity beyond what the rule reads, so it cannot become a back door into
the other aggregate.

#### Where a Domain Service lives

Under `internal/domain/service/<name>/` — outside any aggregate package. **Every Domain Service lives
here, whether it speaks of one aggregate or several.** One placement means one question to answer;
splitting the placement by aggregate count would restore the very decision this rule exists to
remove.

**That placement only means something because the path has its own depguard rule.** An aggregate
package may not import another aggregate; a package under `internal/domain/service/**` may. Everything
else the domain layer forbids is repeated verbatim in that rule — no framework, no infrastructure, no
usecase or controller, no file system, process, or environment access — so the exception widens
exactly one edge and nothing else. Without it, a rule that does reach two aggregates could not be
written anywhere.

**The exception is available, not obligatory.** A service confined to one aggregate imports that
aggregate and stops; nothing about the path pushes it wider, and the rule permits the extra edge
rather than requiring it.

The name is business vocabulary — what the rule is about, never `common` / `shared` / `util`, which
name nothing and therefore refuse nothing.

**Admission is narrow, and the depguard exception is not an invitation.** A package belongs here only
when both hold:

1. The operation is the natural responsibility of no entity and no value object. If it fits on one of
   them, it goes there.
2. It is stateless, and it derives (see *3. Derivation or mapping* above). Reading two aggregates to
   place them side by side is mapping, and mapping stays in Usecase.

A service here holds no I/O: no Repository, no `context.Context`. It receives state the Usecase has
already loaded, and returns a derived value or a domain error. Acquiring that state, ordering the
calls, and owning the transaction remain the Usecase's job.

<!-- sample-api:begin -->
**[`service/membership`](service/membership) spans two aggregates.** It carries one invariant seen
from both sides — a user and their in-progress purchases must not be separated. `EnsurePurchasable`
refuses a purchase by a user who is no longer active; `EnsureWithdrawable` refuses a withdrawal while
any of that user's purchases is still in progress. Neither aggregate can host it: the user aggregate
knows nothing about purchases, and the purchase aggregate knows nothing about membership.

**[`service/dispatch`](service/dispatch) stays inside one.** `GroupForDispatch` divides purchases
awaiting shipment into the sets that may go out together, by buyer. It imports `domain/purchase` and
nothing else, and it is here for the reason above: the answer is about the set, so the purchase
aggregate has no place to put it.
<!-- sample-api:end -->

### Query and Aggregate

Aggregate is a **Write Model**. Which construct executes a given aggregation, report, or complex
search — Repository, QueryService, or CommandService — is decided by
[`docs/design/data-access-pattern.md`](../../docs/design/data-access-pattern.md) and is not restated
here. What this section owns is the question that criterion does not answer: **who authors the
business condition** such a query executes.

**What moves out is the implementation, never the criterion.** "Which products count as low on
stock", "which users count as inactive" — the rule that decides membership is domain vocabulary and
stays in the domain layer, expressed as domain constants and domain predicates. When that rule lives
only in a `WHERE` clause, the domain has lost a business rule to infrastructure, and nothing in this
layer can tell you what the rule is any more.

The distinction matters most where selection is concerned. Naively handing a criterion to a
Repository means fetching everything and filtering in memory, which is not viable; so the criterion
is translated into SQL, an index, or a search engine, and the projection comes back as a DTO the
domain never sees. That translation is expected and correct. What must not travel with it is the
authorship of the criterion.

**"The `WHERE` already guarantees it, so a domain predicate would be redundant" is not an argument.**
Every row a filter returns does satisfy that filter — and that is circular. What the row satisfies is
the condition the query happens to state; whether that condition *is* the business rule is the very
thing left unchecked. The redundancy is real at the level of *execution* and imaginary at the level
of *authorship*, and the argument trades one for the other. The costs are concrete: the meaning of
the term can no longer be answered by reading this layer, a second caller has to restate the
condition with nothing linking the two, and the rule can only be exercised through the database, so
a change in meaning breaks no unit test.

**Not every condition is a criterion.** A condition is one when someone who knows the business would
recognise it as a statement about the business — when the term it decides has a name they use.
Identity lookup, pagination, ordering, and foreign-key joins decide nothing about the business and
this rule does not reach them. Nor does a Repository method whose signature already says the whole
condition: `FindDeletedBefore(ctx, cutoff, …)` states its own criterion, while `FindAllLowStock` does
not. The check is one question — can the meaning of the term be answered by reading the domain
package alone? If not, its authorship has left.

The same discipline is already imposed on the write side, where a CommandService may only enforce
conditions derived from domain invariants ([ADR-0031 (lightweight-cqrs)](../../docs/adr/0031-lightweight-cqrs.md)).
There is no reason for the read side to be the exception.

Read paths are free to skip the aggregate entirely — a search index is a projection of the system of
record, and reconstructing every hit through `FindByID` to re-derive it is not a realistic design.
The domain's claim on a read path is the vocabulary of the question, not the shape of the answer.

## Dependency inversion for Infrastructure layer

Repository is a **persistence abstraction**

```go
type Repository interface {
    FindByActive(ctx context.Context, active *bool, limit, offset int32) (Users, error)
    FindByID(ctx context.Context, id uuid.UUID) (*User, error)
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    Update(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    CountByActive(ctx context.Context, active *bool) (int64, error)
}
```

Implementation:

```text
internal/infrastructure/rdb/repository/<aggregate>/
```

Mapping to Domain is done by `sqlc`.

### Methods allowed in Repository

- `FindByXXX` / `CountByXXX` — fetch by identity, or filter / list / count by the aggregate's own
  attributes
- `LockByXXX` — the same read taken under a pessimistic lock, for a caller that must hold the row
  until commit. The lock and the ordering it requires are stated in the doc comment
  ([ADR-0035 (ordered-pessimistic-row-locks)](../../docs/adr/0035-ordered-pessimistic-row-locks.md))
- `Create` / `Update` — aggregate persistence. A logical delete is an `Update` of `deletedAt`
- `Delete` / `Purge` — physical removal, where the data has no reason to outlive its use and no
  audit trail is owed. Do not add one to an aggregate that keeps history

Assumed operations:

```text
SELECT / WHERE / JOIN
```

### What must not be in Repository

- GROUP BY
- SUM / AVG
- WITH clause
- cross-boundary JOIN — **except** a uniquely-determined JOIN to a reference master nested in this
  aggregate's context, which is part of its semantic set rather than a separate boundary
  (see *Reference master aggregates* above, and
  [`docs/rules.md`](../../docs/rules.md) § Repository / QueryService Rules)

Place them in the read side — QueryService and its ReadModel — with the Usecase ordering the call.
Where each belongs is decided by
[`docs/design/data-access-pattern.md`](../../docs/design/data-access-pattern.md); that criterion is
not restated here.

### Doc comments stay in domain vocabulary

The SQL shapes above bound **what the Infrastructure implementation may do**; they are not the
vocabulary of the doc comments written here. A Repository interface is the seam to persistence, which
is exactly why its doc comment must contract the **guarantee** in domain vocabulary and leave the
**mechanism** to the implementation: `LockByID` states that it takes a pessimistic lock and what that
lock serializes, not that the lock is a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`; a feed method states "ordered by
ordered-at descending, tie-broken by ID", not `(ordered_at DESC, id DESC)`. Table names, column
names, and SQL fragments belong to the Infrastructure doc comment that already states them — see
[`internal/infrastructure/README.md`](../infrastructure/README.md) § Doc comments may name technical
detail, and [`internal/usecase/README.md`](../usecase/README.md) § Doc comments: interface vs
implementation for the rule this mirrors.

Three consequences are specific to Domain:

- **A numeric bound whose reason is the storage width is expressed as a Go integer width**, not as a
  SQL type name — `1..32767` is documented as the positive range of a signed 16-bit integer. That
  keeps the constant from reading as a magic number while staying technology-neutral. Put the reason
  on the constant so the exported constructor's doc stays a pure contract.
- **A reference master is named by its domain name**, never by its table.

  <!-- sample-api:begin -->
  例: 商品ステータスのマスタは「商品ステータス」と呼び、`product_statuses` とは呼ばない。
  <!-- sample-api:end -->
- **A single-fetch method states its not-found behavior** — `FindByID` documents that it returns
  NotFound when the target is absent. The caller branches on that, so it is part of the guarantee,
  not an implementation detail.

## Callable layers

Called from:

- Usecase

Domain **must not call other layers**

Rules that belong to no entity:

- Domain Service

Exception:

```text
read-only aggregate reference
```

## Testing strategy

Domain tests are **pure unit tests**

Forbidden dependencies:

- DB
- HTTP
- environment variables
- time.Now()

### Constructor validation

`New(...)` guarantees **invariants**

Examples:

- zero ID
- boundary values
- time consistency

```go
require.ErrorIs(t, err, ErrInvalidEmail)
```

### Getter contract test

One `TestXxx` **per getter** (`Test<Type>_<Getter>`, one per accessor). Do **not** bundle getters into a single `*_Accessors` / `*_Getters` test (1:1 rule — see [`docs/testing-conventions.md`](../../docs/testing-conventions.md) §1, enforced by `internal/architest`).

Target (one dedicated test each):

```go
func (u *User) ID() uuid.UUID
func (u *User) FirstName() string
func (u *User) Email() string
func (u *User) CreatedAt() time.Time
func (u *User) UpdatedAt() time.Time
```

### Immutable guarantee test

For pointer / reference-returning getters, assert immutability **inside that getter's own `TestXxx`** — not as a separate bundled `TestImmutableAccessors`.

Target:

pointer types:

```go
func (u *User) Building() *string
func (u *User) DeletedAt() *time.Time
```

Verification:

1. modify constructor pointer
2. modify getter return value

Internal state must not change.

### Domain behavior test

Example:

```go
func (u *User) IsActive() bool {
    return u.deletedAt == nil
}
```

### Error classification test

```go
require.ErrorIs(t, err, ErrInvalidEmail)
```

### Test design policy

#### Deterministic

```go
baseTime := time.Date(2025,1,1,0,0,0,0,time.UTC)
```

#### Parallel execution

```go
t.Parallel()
```

Exception: the immutable guarantee test mutates a shared constructor-input
pointer (e.g. `building` / `deletedAt`) to prove the entity copied it. Running
those blocks in parallel races on the shared pointer under `go test -race`, so
keep the mutating blocks serial (omit `t.Parallel()` on them).

#### Fail Fast

```go
require.NoError(t, err)
```

### Test Fixture

Fixture is recommended.

Reasons:

- reduce duplication
- guarantee invariants
- simplify tests

```go
func newTestUser(t *testing.T)*User {
    baseTime := time.Date(2025,1,1,0,0,0,0,time.UTC)

    id := uuid.NewTestFromSalt(t,"user")
    prefectureID := uuid.NewTestFromSalt(t,"prefecture")

    user, err := New(
        id,
        "John",
        "Doe",
        "john@example.com",
        "1234567890",
        prefectureID,
        "Shibuya",
        "1-2-3",
        nil,
        "1500001",
        baseTime,
        baseTime.Add(time.Hour),
        nil,
    )

    require.NoError(t, err)
    return user
}
```

### Invariant preservation test

State transition test:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Before --> Behavior --> After
```

Example:

```go
func TestUser_UpdateEmail(t *testing.T) {
    user := newTestUser(t)

    updatedAt := user.UpdatedAt().Add(time.Hour)

    err := user.UpdateEmail("new@example.com", updatedAt)

    require.NoError(t, err)
    require.Equal(t, "new@example.com", user.Email())
}
```

Invalid case:

```go
require.ErrorIs(t, err, ErrInvalidUpdatedAt)
```

## Do / Don’t

### Do

- guarantee integrity in constructor
- state transition via behavior methods
- ensure consistency via Value Objects
- Repository abstraction
- sequential `t.Run` cases (no table-driven `for` loops — see [`docs/testing-conventions.md`](../../docs/testing-conventions.md))

### Don’t

Forbidden:

- http.*
- echo.*
- sqlc types
- json tags
- setter
- DB-driven design
- time.Now() in Domain
