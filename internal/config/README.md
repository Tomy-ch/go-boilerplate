# `Config` Package

This directory defines configuration files used across the entire application.

## Implementation

This package is responsible for reading application settings from environment variables and providing them as typed structures across the entire application. The main implementation flow is as follows.

- Environment variables are parsed into a `Loader` (including a test `Loader`) and values are loaded using `env.ParseAs[Loader]()` (implementation files: `loader.go` / `envspec.go`).
- The loaded values in `Loader` are converted into a `Config` type, and validation (`validateConfig()`) is performed internally as needed (implementation files: `config.go`, `model.go`).
- The generated `*Config` is treated as immutable (no setters exposed) and is injected into the application via a setup function (`SetUpConfig`) for registering into the DI container (DI related: `internal/di/module/config.go`).

Design points:

- Configuration is loaded collectively at initialization and values are not changed during runtime (treated as immutable).
- Missing required values are detected in `validateConfig()`, and startup failure (explicit error return) is triggered to prevent running in an invalid state.
- Testing helpers and mocks (`config_testing_mock.go`, `config_testing_setter.go`) are provided to allow substituting environment variables and verifying the behavior of `New()` in test environments.

## Config Loading Flow

The configuration loading flow at application startup is as follows.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Env[".env files"]
    Load["Load (godotenv)"]
    Parse["env.ParseAs[Loader]()"]
    Validate["validateConfig()"]
    Config["Config struct"]
    Sub["SubConfig Provider (NewServerConfig etc.)"]
    DI["DI (Uber Fx)"]

    Env --> Load --> Parse --> Validate --> Config --> Sub --> DI
```

### Responsibilities of Each Step

- **Load()**
  - Reads the embedded `env/.env` (via the `go:embed` `root.FS`), parses it with godotenv, and sets each variable only if it is not already set (runtime-injected environment variables take precedence). No `env/.env.<ENV>` file is read.

- **env.ParseAs[Loader]**
  - Maps environment variables into the `Loader` struct defined in `envspec.go`.

- **validateConfig()**
  - Validates port ranges, CIDR, timeout values, etc.
  - Returns an error at startup if there is invalid configuration.

- **Config struct**
  - Converts `Loader` values into internal structures (`model.go`).
  - Treated as an **immutable configuration object** that cannot be modified externally.

- **SubConfig Provider**
  - Through functions such as `NewServerConfig` and `NewDatabaseConfig`
  - Injects only the necessary configuration into each component.

- **DI (Uber Fx)**
  - Registered via `fx.Provide` in `internal/di/module/config.go`
  - Used across the entire application.

## Design Principles

This Config package is implemented based on the following design principles.

- **Configuration is immutable**
  - Configuration is loaded only once at startup and is not changed during runtime.

- **Configuration is loaded only at startup**
  - Initialized in the order `.env → Loader → validateConfig() → Config`.

- **Domain / Usecase must not depend on environment variables**
  - Interpretation of environment variables is confined to the Config layer.

- **Use typed SubConfig providers to obtain configuration**
  - Through providers such as `NewServerConfig` and `NewDatabaseConfig`,
    only the necessary configuration is passed to each component.

This minimizes configuration dependency in the application and improves testability and maintainability.

## Main Libraries Used

- `github.com/caarlos0/env/v11` — Used to map environment variables to structs (tag-based, e.g., `env:"KEY,required"`).
- Since the Uber Fx pattern is adopted for DI registration, configuration values are injected via `fx.Provide` (DI implementation: `internal/di/module/config.go`).
- In tests, assertion libraries such as `testify/require` are used together with project-internal `config_testing_*` helpers to reliably verify environment-variable-based behavior.

## Importance

The following describes importance and expected impact in real-world operations.

### Production Importance

- Level: High
  - Reason: Values essential for operation such as database connection information, authentication information for external services, listening ports, CORS settings, and security settings (HSTS, etc.) are provided via environment variables, so failure to read them correctly leads to startup failure or critical issues.
  - Countermeasure: Required fields should be validated by `validateConfig()` before startup, and an explicit error should be returned when missing.

### Development / Test Importance

- Level: High (however can be substituted with defaults or mocks)
  - Reason: In tests, behavior is verified by setting specific ENV values, so environment variable management is important. Since test helpers are available within the project, reproducibility can be achieved in CI and local tests by combining with `t.Setenv`.
  - Example: Use `config_testing_setter.go` to inject test configuration and verify that `New()` binds correctly.

### Impact if Disabled

- Impact range: Minor to critical (depending on configuration items)
  - Minor: Some options such as log level and debug flags can be safely substituted with default values.
  - Critical: Missing DB connection information or external API keys will cause startup failure or runtime errors.
  - Recommended action: Before production operation, run `go build` and `go test ./...` to ensure validation by `validateConfig()` passes. It is safer to establish a practice of validating required ENV in the CI pipeline.

### How to Add a New Category (e.g., AWS or GCP)

1. Add a new struct for the category in `model.go` (e.g., `AWS` or `GCP`).  
    - Example:

    ```go
    type aws struct {
        accessKey string
        secretKey string
        region    string
    }
    ```

2. Add the new category struct as a field in the `Config` struct.
    - Example:

    ```go
    type Config struct {
        server server
        aws    aws // add new category
    }
    ```

3. Define the new category struct in `envspec.go`.
    - Add `env` tags to each field and specify `required`, `envSeparator`, etc. as needed.
    - Also add the public struct defined in `model.go` to `envspec.go`.
    - Example:

    ```go
    type AWS struct {
        AccessKey string `env:"AWS_ACCESS_KEY,required"`
        SecretKey string `env:"AWS_SECRET_KEY,required"`
        Region    string `env:"AWS_REGION,required"`
    }
    ```

4. Add the new category struct as a field in the `Loader` struct.
    - Example:

    ```go
    type Loader struct {
        Server Server
        AWS    AWS // add new category
    }
    ```

5. In the `New` function of `config.go`, call `env.ParseAs[Loader]()` to automatically bind values from environment variables into `Loader`.
    - Implement validation for the added category inside the `validateConfig()` function if necessary.
    - Finally, convert from `Loader` to `Config` and return the `Config` struct.

    ```go
    func New() (*Config, error) {
        cfg, err := env.ParseAs[Loader]()
        
        if err := validateConfig(cfg); err != nil { // perform validation here
            return nil, err
        }

        return &Config{
            server: server{
                host:           cfg.Server.Host,
                port:           cfg.Server.Port,
                allowedOrigins: cfg.Server.AllowedOrigins,
            },
            aws: aws{
                accessKey: cfg.AWS.AccessKey,
                secretKey: cfg.AWS.SecretKey,
                region:    cfg.AWS.Region,
            },
    }, nil
    }
    ```

6. Implement getter methods for each category as needed to allow external access to values.
    - Creating setter methods is prohibited. The purpose of config.go is limited to retrieving and binding values from environment variables, and modifying configuration values is not intended.
    - Example:

    ```go
    func (c *Config) AWSAccessKey() string {
        return c.aws.accessKey
    }

    func (c *Config) AWSSecretKey() string {
        return c.aws.secretKey
    }

    func (c *Config) AWSRegion() string {
        return c.aws.region
    }
    ```

7. Add test cases for the added category in `config_test.go`.
    - In test cases, set environment variables and call `New()` to verify that values are correctly bound.
    - Example:

    ```go
    func TestNewAWSConfig(t *testing.T) {
        expectedAccessKey := "test_access_key"
        expectedSecretKey := "test_secret_key"
        expectedRegion := "us-west-2"

        t.Setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY", expectedAccessKey)
        t.Setenv("AWS_SECRET_KEY", expectedSecretKey)
        t.Setenv("AWS_REGION", expectedRegion)

        cfg, err := New()
        require.NoError(t, err)

        require.Equal(t, expectedAccessKey, cfg.aws.accessKey)
        require.Equal(t, expectedSecretKey, cfg.aws.secretKey)
        require.Equal(t, expectedRegion, cfg.aws.region)
    }
    ```

    - Also add tests for validation inside the `validateConfig` function.

8. Similar to existing `NewHogehogeConfig`, ensure the signature where DI receives `*config.Config` and returns a public type (`*config.AWSConfig`).

```go
// internal/config/aws_config.go (example)
package config

type AWSConfig struct {
    AccessKey string
    SecretKey string
    Region    string
}

// NewAWSConfig receives *config.Config from DI and returns a public type *config.AWSConfig used by services
func NewAWSConfig(cfg *Config) *AWSConfig {
    return &AWSConfig{
        AccessKey: cfg.aws.accessKey,
        SecretKey: cfg.aws.secretKey,
        Region:    cfg.aws.region,
    }
}
```

Points:

- Follow project naming conventions for field names and struct names.
- After adding a provider to DI, register the component that receives that type (e.g., AWS client factory) in the DI container.
- Missing additions or type mismatches will cause build errors, so verify with `go build` and `go test ./...`.

### Test exceptions (files not required to reach full unit coverage)

Most of this package (SubConfig getters, `New()` binding, the test setters) is expected to
stay near 100% unit coverage. The following are the **intentional exceptions**: their
uncovered parts are error branches on the loading / composition boundary that cannot be
exercised without failure injection, and the real path is already verified end-to-end by
the boot-check CI (`app-di-startup-check` / `worker-boot-check` / `job-boot-check`, which
run the actual binary through `SetUpConfig`).

|File|Function|Why not unit-tested|
|---|---|---|
|`loader.go`|`Load`|The remaining branches are I/O failures on the **embedded** env file (`root.FS.ReadFile` / `godotenv.Parse` / `os.Setenv`). These effectively never fail at runtime and would need an injected failing FS / env to hit.|
|`setup.go`|`SetUpConfig`|Composition-root glue called from `cmd/` (itself excluded from the coverage gate). Only the `Load()` error early-return is uncovered; startup is exercised by the boot-check CI.|

> Do **not** add contrived failure-injection tests just to color these lines. If one of
> these functions gains real branching logic (not I/O error plumbing), that logic must be
> unit-tested like everything else.
>
> **Governance:** coverage exceptions are **not added at will**. A new entry may be recorded
> in this section **only with an appropriate approver's (e.g. architect) sign-off**.

## Notes

- For security reasons, do not hardcode sensitive information (e.g., API keys or passwords) in code. Manage them via environment variables.

## Test Strategy

Config is the one place that reads the process environment and the filesystem, so its tests are the exception to the parallel mandate rather than the rule.

- **Per-validator boundaries** — each `validate*` function has its own `TestXxx` asserting both sides of every rule it enforces (accepted value and the specific rejection). A validator tested only on the happy path leaves a misconfiguration to be discovered at runtime, which is what these functions exist to prevent.
- **Env / CWD mutation is serial by necessity** — subjects that call `t.Setenv` / `t.Chdir` (config loading and the test-support helpers such as `EnsureRepoRootAndEnv`) cannot call `t.Parallel()`. Mark them `//nolint:paralleltest` with the one-line reason, per `docs/testing-conventions.md` §3. Do not work around this by mutating `os.Environ` directly.
- **Loading precedence** — when a value can come from more than one source, assert which one wins, not merely that a value was produced.
- **The embedded env file is checked against `envspec.go`, not transcribed** — an `.env` file is data that nothing compiles against, so a variable declared without an `envDefault` yet absent from the file and a key left stranded by a rename are both invisible to a behavior test. `TestEmbeddedEnvConsistency` derives the key set from `Loader`'s struct tags by reflection and asserts **key presence** against the parsed file in both directions. Derive that set — a hand-written key list is a copy of the file it is meant to check, and drifts along with it.
- **Value drift is caught per key, not in bulk** — values cannot be compared wholesale, because the expectations in `config_testing_mock.go` are deliberately distinct sentinels (`APP_NAME` is `TestApp`, not the file's `Boilerplate`) so that a test proves *which* key it read. Pin a value one key at a time, and only where the expectation is meant to mirror the file — `OBS_TARGET_STATUS_CODES` alone today; every other key can still drift undetected. The scope is the embedded file only, which is `env/.env` locally and `env/.env.ci` under `make materialize-env`; the deploy files (`dev` / `stg` / `prd`) hold different values by design and never become the embedded file under test. Whether such a difference is that design or a propagation miss is not this package's question — it is settled across the whole env file family by `TestEnvTargetStatusCodesPolicy` in `internal/architest`, against the per-environment policy documented in `env/README.md`.
- **The embedded env's provenance is captured, not merely loaded** — `Load` records the embedded `APP_ENV` into `embeddedAppEnv` *before* the runtime-env merge, and the production-mode provenance guard reads that captured value rather than the effective one. Assert the capture with a conflicting runtime `APP_ENV` in place and derive the expectation from the embedded file; a test that reads back the loaded value cannot distinguish the baked-in provenance from the injected one, which is the only thing the guard exists to tell apart.
- **Test doubles are the ones this package ships** — other layers consume `MockConfigForTest(t)` and the `Set*(t, …)` setters rather than constructing a `Config` by hand; the setters restore via `t.Cleanup`, and that restoration is itself part of the contract to assert. See [Test Support](#test-support) for the inventory — do not duplicate it here.
