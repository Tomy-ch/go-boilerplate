# infrastructure/objectstorage

Adapters that implement the object-storage seam (`internal/usecase/boundary/objectstorage`)
against a concrete storage service.

## Role

Implements the `objectstorage.Storage` port. `New` in this package selects the implementation;
`s3/` holds the S3-compatible one. Vendor vocabulary (bucket / region / endpoint / SDK types)
stops here — the port above exposes only a key, bytes, and content metadata.

## Directory Structure

|Path|Role|
|---|---|
|`objectstorage.go`|The single place that chooses an implementation. Both the DI graph and the CLI call it, so retargeting the substrate is a one-function edit|
|`s3/`|S3-compatible adapter (AWS SDK v2). `New(Config, TracerFactory)` returns the port; the concrete type stays unexported|

## Layout convention

- **Substrate-agnostic contract** lives at `internal/usecase/boundary/objectstorage` (the seam),
  above this layer — not here. Infrastructure implements that port; it does not own the abstraction.
- **Substrate-specific adapter** lives at `objectstorage/<substrate>/` (e.g. `objectstorage/s3`).
  The package name is the substrate, so the concrete technology stays visible at the import site.

## Port mapping

| seam | S3 |
| --- | --- |
| `Put(ctx, PutObject) (Path, error)` | `PutObject`. `Key` → `Key` (under the configured `Bucket`), `Body` → body + `ContentLength`, `ContentType` → `ContentType`, `CacheControl` → `CacheControl`. An empty `CacheControl` leaves the field unset rather than sending an empty header, so "no caching directive" stays distinguishable from "an empty one" |
| return `Path` | The key that was written, echoed back. The adapter never returns a URL — composing one is the caller's job, because the delivery origin is not a property of the store |

## Error normalization

Every SDK failure is wrapped into `apperror.ErrUnavailable` at the single call site in `Put`, so
upper layers branch on the sentinel and never inspect an AWS error type. This is deliberately
**coarser than the RDB side**: `rdb/pgerror` maps SQLSTATE to distinct sentinels because callers
act differently on a unique-violation than on a deadlock, whereas the current port has one
operation whose failures are all "the store did not accept the write". Splitting the mapping is
worth doing when an operation is added whose caller must distinguish not-found from denied.

## Config

`s3.Config` is populated from `OBJECT_STORAGE_*` (see [env/README.md](../../../env/README.md)):

- `Endpoint` — empty means SDK default resolution, i.e. real AWS S3. A non-empty value points at
  a compatible service (locally, the Garage container)
- `UsePathStyle` — must be `true` for Garage / MinIO, `false` for AWS S3
- `Region` is used for request signing even against a non-AWS service

## Observability

`Put` opens an infrastructure-layer span via the injected `TracerFactory`, so a store call appears
in the same trace as the handler and usecase that triggered it. The adapter emits no logs of its
own; failures surface through the normalized error.

## Wired by default — unlike the SQS adapter

This adapter **is** in the default DI graph, so `aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3` is linked into the
shipped binary. That is the opposite of [`queue/sqs`](../queue/sqs/README.md), which is
deliberately left unwired to keep the AWS SDK out of the binary
([ADR-0044](../../../docs/adr/0044-sqs-adapter-opt-in.md)).

The asymmetry is intentional: a worker has no broker until an integrator chooses one, whereas the
object-storage port is exercised by the template out of the box and needs a working implementation
to be more than a declaration. A fork that stores nothing can drop `objectStorageModule()` from
`InfrastructureModule()`.

## Test strategy

- **Unit tests run against `gofakes3` in-process** — no container, so `make test` needs nothing
  running. The fake is started per test and speaks enough of the S3 API to exercise the adapter
- **The Garage container is for `make serve`**, not for tests. Anything asserted about real
  delivery (public read, cache headers) is verified by hand against that container
- `gofakes3` does not persist every header it receives (`Cache-Control` among them), so assertions
  about headers the adapter *sends* inspect the outgoing request rather than the stored object

## S3 is one worked example, not the target

The seam is substrate-agnostic, but a template that ships only an abstraction proves nothing — the
port is only credible once something real is wired through it. So one substrate is implemented
concretely, and the S3 API is that one. It is the **reference**, not the assumption: the S3 API is
the closest thing this space has to a lingua franca, which is why the local container is Garage
rather than AWS itself.

To keep that claim honest rather than aspirational, here is the local container each major
provider's object storage is developed against, so a fork can stand up the equivalent loop on day one.

|Provider|Service|Local container|License|Published by|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|AWS (and any S3-compatible)|S3|`dxflrs/garage`|AGPL-3.0|Deuxfleurs (non-profit)|
|Azure|Blob Storage|`mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite`|MIT|Microsoft|
|GCP|Cloud Storage|`fsouza/fake-gcs-server`|BSD-2-Clause|fsouza (individual maintainer)|

Selection follows the same rule as every other dependency here — one replaceable job per component
([ADR-0068](../../../docs/adr/0068-library-selection-policy.md)) — so a single-purpose emulator is
preferred over a suite that emulates a whole cloud. Notes per choice:

- **Garage** speaks the S3 API and nothing else, and stays small enough to run per checkout. Its
  AGPL-3.0 terms attach to distributing a modified Garage; running the published image as a
  development dependency places no obligation on the application that talks to it
- **Azurite** is Microsoft's own emulator and covers Blob *and* Queue, so Azure needs one container
  for both this seam and the worker seam
- **fake-gcs-server** is the de-facto Cloud Storage emulator and the only one with a real user base,
  but it is the one entry here maintained by an individual rather than an organization, and its
  tagged releases are slower than the others. Weigh that before depending on it in CI

Anything S3-compatible (MinIO, Ceph RGW, Cloudflare R2, a managed S3) needs no adapter change at
all — only `OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` and credentials. A non-S3 substrate needs a sibling package
under `objectstorage/`, with nothing above this layer changing.
