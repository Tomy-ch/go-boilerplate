description: >-
  Drive a GitHub issue from environment setup to a merged PR as a semi-automatic pipeline whose stopping points are enumerated rather than judged. Use whenever the user hands over an issue URL or number to be worked end-to-end ("この issue やって", "wt 上で解決しよう", "着手して PR まで"), or asks to resume such a run. It owns three things — progress orchestration, reconciling the approved plan against what was actually built, and mechanically detecting the moments needing a human call — and no implementation judgment: the work is delegated to `commit` / `submit-pr` and to the three peer review skills `impl-review` / `test-review` / `comment-sweep`, and design decisions are surfaced, never taken. It sets up an isolated worktree and DB slot, has a different model draft a written plan the user approves before coding, then watches five mechanical trip-wires so drift becomes visible instead of silent. The plan's approval covers the whole run, and the skill carries a closed list of the five places it may stop — everywhere else it continues and records the call for the PR. Runtime verification (`make serve` + curl + LGTM traces) runs after the PR is opened and gates the merge; green CI is not a substitute. Three modes are confirmed once: review mode, issue mode, and flow mode. Do NOT use for a change with no issue behind it (`commit` + `submit-pr`), for reviewing an existing diff (`impl-review` / `test-review` / `comment-sweep`), or for authoring skills (`manage-skill`).

# Impl Issue

Semi-automatic issue → PR pipeline. The machine handles progression, bookkeeping, and detection; the
human keeps every judgment call. A long autonomous run stops being a black box because each departure
from the approved plan surfaces when it happens rather than at the end.

The commands live here so a run is reproducible from this file alone. Detail that drives itself stays
behind pointers: `.makefiles/README.md` (target registry), `docs/maintenance/db-worktree-pool.md`
(slot pool), `docs/development-flow.md` (per-change-type flows).

A Japanese reference translation lives at `SKILL.ja.md` in this directory (for human reference only;
not loaded as a skill).

## When to Use

- The user hands over an issue URL / number and wants it taken to a merged PR.
- The user asks to resume a run that stopped at a decision point.

Do NOT use it for a change with no issue behind it (`commit` + `submit-pr` directly), for reviewing an
existing diff (`impl-review` / `test-review` / `comment-sweep`), or for authoring skills
(`manage-skill`).

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | Progressing the issue → merged PR pipeline, reconciling the approved plan with the implementation, and mechanically detecting when human judgment is required |
| **Never** | Fill in unresolved design decisions independently / make implementation judgments (delegatees own them) |
| **Starts when** | An accepted issue is presented |
| **Stops when** | Only at the five places listed below; everywhere else it continues and records the call for the PR comment |

## Stopping — the complete list

Where this pipeline stops is a specification, not a judgment. It stops here and nowhere else:

| # | Where | What is decided |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Step 0 | The three modes, in one call, before anything else |
| 2 | Step 3 | Approval of the written plan |
| 3 | Step 4 | A trip-wire whose row says halt |
| 4 | Step 7 | Which of the three peer review skills to run, each with its estimated return |
| 5 | Step 8 | Runtime verification failed; and the merge itself |

Three moments look like stopping points and are not. Each is where an unlisted stop otherwise creeps
in:

- **A phase boundary.** The Step 3 approval covers Steps 4–9, because the plan enumerates the whole
  run and that is what was approved. A phase ending is not an event.
- **A delegated agent's completion notification.** Reviews and audits fan out; a report arriving is
  where work resumes, not where it pauses.
- **A mode settled in Step 0.** That is spent authority. Re-confirming a fix which review mode already
  authorized asks the user to approve the same thing twice.

Asked one at a time, a stop always looks cheap while its cost is diffuse, so "ask" wins every
individual judgment. That is why the list above is closed rather than advisory.

## What this skill does NOT do

It holds no implementation judgment. It never decides which design to adopt, whether a reviewer is
right, or whether a finding deserves an issue. It routes those to the user and records the answer.

| Work | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Commit splitting and execution | `commit` |
| Push + PR create/update | `submit-pr` |
| Review of the change itself | `impl-review` |
| Review of the tests | `test-review` |
| Review of the comment stock | `comment-sweep` |
| The implementation itself | you, following the approved plan |

The three review skills are peers: none invokes another, and each is asked for separately (Step 7).

## AI Modification Scope

`AGENTS.md` confines AI edits to `internal/` / `pkg/` / `database/` / `openapi/` and treats everything
else — `.github/workflows/`, `docker/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `.makefiles/`, root dotfiles — as out of
scope. **Invoking this skill is the explicit user instruction that relaxes that**, because this skill
is issue-generic: the issue decides the surface, and an issue about CI, tooling, container images, or
documentation cannot be resolved inside the four default directories. This is a documented,
non-loophole exception per the "Skills must not be a loophole" clause in `AGENTS.md`.

The relaxation is bounded, and the bound is the plan:

- The Step 3 plan's **Files to touch** section is the permitted surface. A sensitive path outside the
  four default directories must appear there **before** it is edited, named explicitly rather than
  implied by a glob.
- Say so when presenting the plan. The user approves the sensitive paths knowingly, not by discovering
  them in the diff — a plan that quietly widens the scope is the failure this clause exists to prevent.
- Reaching a sensitive path the plan does not list halts under either flow mode (trip-wire 1′,
  Step 4). Ask; do not widen the surface and report it afterwards.

Hard-protected even during this skill (never touch, regardless of what the issue asks):

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
- Generated files: `**/*.gen.go`, `*.sql.go`, `*_mock.go`, `**/openapi.gen.yaml`, and generated content
  under `docs/` (`docs/openapi/**`, `docs/coverage/**`, `docs/db-schema/**`, `docs/godoc/**`,
  `docs/portal/docs.json`, `docs/portal/guides/**`). Regenerating through a `make` target is fine;
  hand-editing is not.
- Anything under `permissions.deny` in the agent's own permission configuration
- Existing files under `database/migrations/**` (new migration files only)

## Step 0 — Confirm the three modes (one `ask the user explicitly` interaction)

Ask once, before anything else, in one `ask the user explicitly` interaction containing all three
questions. Defaults are marked; the user's choice always wins. Do not turn this into a sequence of
separate questions.

**Review mode** — what happens to a review finding.

| Mode | Confirmed finding | Everything else |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `all` | Apply, even if the change is large | — |
| `harmful` *(default)* | Apply only what is clearly harmful within the change's scope | Route to issue mode |
| `issues` | Apply nothing | Route to issue mode |

**Issue mode** — how an unrelated finding becomes tracked.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `search` *(default)* | Search existing issues first; on a duplicate, comment there instead of filing |
| `file` | File without searching |

`issues` × `file` produces the most new issues of any combination. Before executing it, show the count
and confirm — a review easily yields a dozen findings, and a dozen new issues is itself noise.

**Flow mode** — what a trip-wire does. The names carry their trigger because this mode governs
trip-wires only; it is not a posture for the run, and it reaches none of the other four stopping
points.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `record-on-tripwire` *(default)* | Record the call and continue; surface every recorded call in one PR comment at the end |
| `halt-on-tripwire` | Stop at that trip-wire and ask |

**Neither mode reaches the trip-wires marked halt in Step 4.** Those are architecture, domain and
policy decisions, which `AGENTS.md` keeps behind a human gate unconditionally. The mode decides only
what happens at the remaining rows: `record-on-tripwire` continues and records them,
`halt-on-tripwire` asks about them too — worth picking when the user is present and wants scope
growth surfaced as it happens rather than at the end.

## Step 1 — Kickoff

```bash
printf '\033]0;%s\007' "<issue-number>-<slug>"   # label the window so parallel runs stay distinguishable
gh issue view <n> --json number,title,body,labels,state,comments
```

**Compare the issue against the actual base before writing anything.** An issue body is a snapshot of
the repo as it was when someone wrote it; line numbers, "X does not exist yet", and "Y has no consumer"
go stale. Verify each factual claim against the base you are about to branch from.

Then post a kickoff comment recording branch name, base commit, isolation method, and — most
importantly — **every discrepancy found above**. This marks the issue as taken and gets the
corrections to the user while they are still cheap.

```bash
gh issue comment <n> --body-file <file>
```

## Step 2 — Secure the environment

Do this before any code is touched, so nothing lands in a shared checkout.

When resuming an existing worktree, first inspect it without changing state: confirm the worktree
path, whether `vendor/` exists, and whether `.gobp-db-slot` exists. A missing slot means that DB work
must run `make slot-acquire` immediately before it begins; do **not** acquire it merely to resume the
conversation. Never run slot acquisition or DB reinitialization as an unconditional resume action.

### [Codex-side difference]

Codex has no verified session-start hook contract in this repository. This resume check therefore
lives in Step 2 rather than in `.codex/hooks.json`. Keep it here when synchronizing the skill: a
Claude-side session hook may provide the same observation, but must not cause Codex to acquire a DB
slot or reinitialize a database on resume.

```bash
# 1. Resolve the active release line off origin's live state.
BASE=$(make -s base-branch)
test -n "$BASE" || { echo "ベースブランチを解決できませんでした"; exit 1; }

# 2. Branch from current origin, not a stale local ref.
git fetch origin "$BASE"
mkdir -p .codex/worktrees
git worktree add -b feature/<n>-<slug> .codex/worktrees/<n>-<slug> "origin/$BASE"

# 3. Lease a DB slot: own databases (wt<N>_local / wt<N>_test), API port 8080+N, mock-auth 2010+N.
cd .codex/worktrees/<n>-<slug> && make slot-acquire

# 4. A fresh worktree has no vendor/ and air builds with --mod=vendor, so serve would fail without this.
go mod vendor
```

`.codex/worktrees/` is a linked-worktree container inside the trusted workspace, so ordinary work
does not cross the sandbox write boundary. It is ignored because the parent checkout otherwise sees
each linked worktree as untracked. Never run `git clean -fdx` in the parent checkout: it can delete
these worktrees. The repository's local-safety rule forbids `git clean`; do not request an exception
to clean this directory.

`make base-branch` reads `origin`'s live state. Use nothing else: the local `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
is fixed at clone time and `git fetch` never updates it, the GitHub default branch can stay on an
earlier release line, and an agent- or environment-supplied “main branch” hint can report that stale
local symref. All three answer without warning, so a branch cut from a generation-old base can appear
valid while expected files are missing.

If `slot-acquire` reports failure, run `make slot-status` before retrying — the lease often succeeded
even when the command errored.

**Never release the slot on your own, and do not offer to during cleanup.** A slot is cheap to hold
(the lease is reclaimed automatically once stale) and expensive to lose mid-task; only the user knows
when the work is really over.

If the user's instruction named a release version **other than the resolved one**, ask before branching
— a deliberate backport target is the one case the resolver cannot know about.

## Step 3 — Plan, then wait

Use Codex's agent delegation mechanism to have a **different model** draft the plan — a second model
catches what the implementer's own blind spots would otherwise carry straight into the code. Give it
the issue, your Step 1 corrections, and the paths you have already read. Tell it to verify your
summary rather than trust it. If the current Codex surface cannot dispatch an agent on a different
model, state that limitation explicitly: draft the plan yourself, then make a separate critique pass
against the issue and code before presenting it. Do not silently drop the different-model requirement.

The plan is a written artifact, not a chat message, because Step 5 compares against it mechanically.
Write it under the repo's gitignored `tmp/` (it may be a symlink to a directory outside the repo if
the operator prefers). It must contain:

| Section | Why it is required |
| --- | --- |
| Files to touch | Step 5 diffs this against `git diff --name-only` |
| Per-step deliverables | Lets a partially-finished run be resumed or handed over |
| Chosen options **and rejected ones, with reasons** | Trip-wire 2 fires when a rejected option is later adopted |
| Gate table | Fixes at plan time whether runtime verification is required, so it cannot be quietly dropped |

Present the plan and **wait for approval. Do not implement before it.**

**That approval covers Steps 4–9.** The plan enumerates the whole run, so no phase inside it needs
approving again; the run continues to the next stopping point on its own.

## Step 4 — Implement, watching five trip-wires

The plan is approved and implementation begins — the boundary between deciding and building, which
only this skill knows:

```sh
.agents/closed-loop/marks.sh planApprovedAt 2>/dev/null || true
.agents/closed-loop/marks.sh implStartedAt 2>/dev/null || true
```

Follow the approved plan. These triggers are deliberately mechanical — relying on you to *notice* that
a decision was significant is exactly how drift goes unreported.

| # | Trip-wire | Default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Touching a file the plan does not list, **inside** the four default directories | Record | Scope grew, but within the surface `AGENTS.md` already permits |
| 1′ | The same, **outside** them (`docker/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, `docs/`, `.makefiles/`, root dotfiles) | **Halt** | The plan is the permitted surface; widening it is the user's call |
| 2 | Choosing an option the plan rejected, or a third one | **Halt** | The rejection had a reason; overriding it silently discards that reasoning |
| 3 | A lint/CI failure rooted in an architecture rule (`interfacebloat`, `gocognit`, `depguard`, architest, …) | **Halt** | These are not formatting — satisfying them changes the design |
| 4 | Rejecting a reviewer's finding, or applying a different fix than proposed | **Halt** | A finding can be correct while its proposed fix is harmful; that judgment is not yours alone |
| 5 | Skipping a gate | Record | Step 6 already requires stating it in the PR |

**Halt rows halt under either flow mode** — they are the human gate `AGENTS.md` places on architecture,
domain and policy decisions. When one fires, present the situation with your recommendation.
`halt-on-tripwire` extends that treatment to the Record rows; `record-on-tripwire` logs them and
continues, and Step 9 surfaces every recorded call in one PR comment.

### When code generation is blocked

The generation make targets wrap `docker compose run … make <target>-ci`, and the `-ci` halves run on
the host with mise-installed tools. When the container runtime is unavailable, call them directly:

```bash
make merge-dml-ci work-dir="."     # DML concatenation
make sqlc-generate-ci              # sqlc
make gen-bundle-oapi-ci            # OpenAPI bundle
make gen-api-docs-ci               # docs/openapi/index.html
cd <pkg> && mockgen -source=<f>.go -destination=mock/mock_<f>.go.gen.go -package=mock_<pkg>
```

Only `make dump-schema` truly needs the container, and only when a migration was added.

Two traps. `merge-dml-ci` runs `go run ./cmd/`, so adding a Repository method before its query exists
deadlocks the build — stub the implementation for the duration of generation, then restore it (`cp`
the file first). The embedded-spec generator's `//go:generate` line points at a container path, so
invoke it with the real path:

```bash
cd internal/controller/httpstack/oapi/validator \
  && oapi-codegen --package=gen --generate=spec -o ./gen/validate.gen.go <repo>/openapi/openapi.gen.yaml
```

Changing an OpenAPI description alone still moves three artifacts: the bundle, `docs/openapi/index.html`,
and that embedded spec. Miss one and CI's generate checks fail.

## Step 5 — Reconcile the plan against reality

Run this before the gates. Compare:

- `git diff --name-only` against the plan's file list — report additions and untouched entries.
- Options actually taken against the plan's chosen/rejected lists.
- Gate table entries against what you actually ran.

Present the deltas. A long run drifts for good reasons; the problem is drift the user never saw. If
nothing drifted, say so in one line and move on.

## Step 6 — Local gates

`make fix`, then `make lint` / `make test`. When many worktrees are active these may be left to CI,
but **say in the PR that they were not run locally**. Silence reads as "verified".

Runtime verification is deliberately *not* here. It belongs after the PR exists (Step 8), so CI runs
in parallel with it instead of after it.

## Step 7 — Review

A completed change has three review subjects, each owned by one skill: `impl-review` (the change),
`test-review` (the tests), `comment-sweep` (the comment stock of the touched files). They are peers —
none invokes another — so this step must not silently pick one.

Follow the Review Phase Protocol in `AGENTS.md`: **estimate each skill's return from the context this
run already holds** — which layers the change touched, whether tests or comments moved at all, what an
earlier pass already covered — then ask the user per skill, stating that estimate and its reason, and
run what they approve. "Shall I run all three?" is not a question; it hands the cost back unpriced.

This step is where the estimate is cheapest to make: the plan, the diff, and the Step 5 reconciliation
are already in hand.

Handle findings per the review mode from Step 0. Auto-application is confined to what is
machine-checkable — formatting, lint fixes, comment-quality findings, regenerated artifacts. **A fix
that changes the design is always a decision point**, even under review mode `all`: `all` authorizes a
large rewrite, not an unreviewed one.

Then present every recorded trip-wire and deferred judgment together, in one place. Batching beats
trickling: the user sees the shape of the whole run at once.

## Step 8 — PR, then runtime verification, then merge

When this step merges the pull request, stamp it — a merge performed here is observed by nobody
else until the loop goes back to `gh` for it:

```sh
.agents/closed-loop/marks.sh mergedAt 2>/dev/null || true
```

Open the PR first via `submit-pr`, so CI starts while you verify locally.

### Runtime verification — the merge gate

Exercise the real HTTP path against the running system. No mode relaxes this.

```bash
make serve                                    # API on 8080+N, mock-auth on 2010+N

TOKEN=$(curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:201N/default/token \
  -d 'grant_type=password' \
  -d 'client_id=go-boilerplate-client' \
  -d 'password=unused' \
  --data-urlencode 'username=<seeded-subject>' \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')

curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:808N/v1/...
```

`docs/design/auth.md` is canonical for this — the mock provider's standard token endpoint,
minting a token without a browser. Where this snippet and that document disagree, the
document decides.

The token subject must be the identity `subject` string the seed registered, not an internal UUID —
the seeded UUID rows belong to a different issuer than the one the slot's port produces, so a UUID
yields a confusing 401. Resolve real subjects from the identity table when unsure:

```bash
docker exec gobp-shared-database-1 psql -U postgres -d wt<N>_local -c \
  "select subject from <identity table> where issuer = 'http://localhost:201N/default';"
```

Check the happy path, the error paths the change introduces, and — for a protected operation — that
omitting the token gives 401. Then **read the traces in the LGTM stack and confirm the request took
the path you expect** (controller → usecase → infrastructure, with the SQL you intended). A response
code alone does not prove the request reached the layer you changed; a wrong-but-plausible route
produces the right status for the wrong reason.

**Green CI is not a substitute.** Review lenses and CI checks are static analysis or tests that stop
at the database layer, so a documented status code that the middleware never lets the request reach
passes all of them. One real HTTP request settles it.

When runtime verification cannot run at all, there are two honest options and no third:

1. Do not merge yet.
2. Add an integration test driving the same HTTP path, and merge on that.

Say plainly which one you took.

### Merge

Wait for CI without repeatedly foreground-polling in separate sleep calls. Run this as one
long-running command and use Codex's background/yield-and-notify mechanism when the current surface
provides it, so one completion notification arrives. If that mechanism is unavailable, retain the
single loop below and state that it blocks; do not replace it with a foreground sleep-poll sequence:

```bash
until [ "$(gh pr checks <n> --json bucket --jq '[.[]|select(.bucket=="pending")]|length')" = "0" ]; do sleep 30; done
gh pr checks <n>
```

Then `gh pr merge <n> --merge`.

## Step 9 — Close out

Close the issue **manually** — auto-closing keywords do not fire when the PR targets a release branch
rather than the default branch:

```bash
gh issue comment <n> --body-file <handover> && gh issue close <n>
```

The handover comment covers what was decided, what surprised you relative to the plan, and what was
deliberately left undone.

Route findings that fall outside the change to the tracker per the issue mode. Under `search`, prefer
a follow-up comment on an existing issue over a new one — the issue count is itself a cost, and a
duplicate buries the original.

**Verify a finding against the running system before filing it.** A finding derived purely from
reading code can be wrong in a way static review cannot catch — most often because a layer outside
the one being read (middleware, DI wiring, the database) already handles the case. Step 8's runtime
stage is usually enough to check.

Finally, record in a PR comment any call not already visible in a commit message or the PR
description. Every trip-wire recorded rather than halted on lands here.

## Delegating without double-asking

Sub-skills ask their own questions. Since this skill already settled them with the user, pass the
answers as a payload so the sub-skill skips its own gate.

| Sub-skill | Pass through | Suppresses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commit` | The grouping you already presented | Its grouping-approval question |
| `submit-pr` | That a review already ran; the push decision | Its Phase 0 review prompt and push confirmation |
| `impl-review` | Scope, reviewer model | Its Step 0 |
| `test-review` | Scope, reviewer model | Its scope question |
| `comment-sweep` | Scope **and apply mode** | Its scope and apply-mode questions |

**Every row is required, because a missing one reinstates a gate this skill already settled.** A
sub-skill whose default is to confirm per item — `comment-sweep` is the one to watch — will do exactly
that when its apply mode does not arrive, and the omission is invisible until the questions start.

Asking the user the same thing twice trains them to approve without reading, which defeats the
decision points this skill exists to create.

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Secure the worktree and slot before touching code.
- ✅ Verify the issue's claims against the actual base, and put the discrepancies in the kickoff comment.
- ✅ Get the plan approved before implementing, and keep it as a file so Step 5 can diff against it.
- ✅ Treat the five trip-wires as mechanical triggers, not as things to notice.
- ✅ Stop only at the five listed places; record every other call for the PR comment.
- ✅ Pass every sub-skill its settled answers, apply mode included.
- ✅ Say explicitly which gates ran and which did not.
- ✅ Read the traces, not just the status code.
- ✅ Verify a finding at runtime before filing an issue for it.
- ❌ Merge a change to implementation code that has never been exercised over HTTP.
- ❌ Present green CI as runtime verification.
- ❌ Auto-apply a fix that changes the design, in any mode.
- ❌ Ask for approval at a phase boundary, or treat a delegated agent's completion as one.
- ❌ Pick which review skills run, or run one on the assumption another chains it.
- ❌ File an issue without checking for an existing one, unless issue mode says to.
- ❌ Release the DB slot, or ask about releasing it, unprompted.
- ❌ Poll CI in a foreground sleep loop.
