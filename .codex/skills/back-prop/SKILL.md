description: Detect and reconcile drift between implementation, canonical README files, repository skills, the DDD pattern ledger, and business vocabulary. Use after a multi-layer refactor, before a major review, or for documentation hygiene. Audit changed files by default, classify README-to-code drift, undocumented recurring code patterns, skill-to-README duplication, DDD-ledger-to-ADR/README-corpus drift, and glossary terms leaked into layer READMEs, ADRs, or rules. Propose only individually approvable documentation changes; ADR/rules glossary leaks are report-only. Never change implementation code with this skill.

# Documentation Drift Review

For the Japanese reference translation, see `SKILL.ja.md` (not loaded as a skill).

The authority order is **README > code > skill**. This skill discovers drift; it does not use implementation behavior to silently overwrite a documented decision.

## Scope and categories

Default to changed production Go files against an existing PR's `baseRefName`; without a PR, resolve the base with `make base-branch`, which reads `origin`'s live state and returns the latest release line. Never fall back to `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`, because the GitHub default branch may name an earlier release line. If the base cannot be resolved, stop and report that in Japanese rather than continuing: an empty file list fans out zero detectors and would be indistinguishable from a clean no-drift result. Allow a requested full scan or named layers. Exclude generated files, mocks, and tests. Ask once for scope and a multi-select of categories; default to all five.

Audit only the requested categories:

- **A — README → code:** implementation violates or no longer matches a documented convention.
- **B — code → README:** a recurring, intentional-looking implementation pattern lacks documentation. Require evidence from at least three independent occurrences before reporting it.
- **C — skill ↔ README:** a skill duplicates stale rules or contradicts the canonical README.
- **D — DDD ledger ↔ ADR/README corpus:** the DDD pattern ledger's pointers or stated coverage no
  longer match the canonical corpus. This is bookkeeping drift, not an assessment of fidelity to
  Evans; `ddd-audit` owns that external comparison.
- **E — business glossary ↔ structural prose:** a term in `docs/spec/glossary.md` has appeared in
  prose intended for implementation structure or decisions. The glossary's Terms table and
  Mechanism vocabulary section decide the vocabulary; this skill never does.

Map Go files to `domain`, `usecase`, `controller`, `infrastructure`, or `pkg`. For category D, read
the `corpus` globs from `.agents/ddd-audit/pattern-ledger.yaml` at runtime (never hardcode them) and
intersect them with the changed files; inspect the complete corpus for a full scan. Run
`.codex/agents/drift-detector-ddd.toml` whenever D has an in-scope corpus, alongside layer detectors.
For E, resolve the prose corpus at runtime: `internal/**/README.md`, `pkg/**/README.md`,
`docs/adr/*.md`, `docs/rules.md`, and `docs/architecture.md`, excluding `*.ja.md`. Run
`.codex/agents/drift-detector-glossary.toml` when the E intersection with changed files is non-empty,
or always for a full scan. Pass it the resolved prose file list and no categories, in the same
parallel fan-out as the layer detectors. If `docs/spec/glossary.md` is absent, skip the detector and
say why; its Terms table is the probe list. E can be selected for prose-only changes. Report changed
files outside these layers and the DDD/E corpus as not audited. If no in-scope files exist, stop
cleanly.

## Read-only detection

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, then the relevant layer README and nearest subpackage README. Read the matching Codex skill only for category C. For D, read the ledger and only its runtime-resolved corpus. For E, the glossary detector reads the glossary, exclusions, and only its runtime-resolved prose corpus.
2. Inspect the scoped code and collect concrete file-and-line evidence. Use sibling code as supporting evidence, never as a substitute for an explicit rule.
3. Compare each finding against the authority order:

   - For A, recommend a code correction or an explicit documented exception; do not edit code.
   - For B, offer a README addition only when the three-occurrence threshold and intent evidence are met. Otherwise report nothing.
   - For C, remove duplicated procedural rules from the skill or update it to point at the README; do not copy README rules into the skill.
   - For D, surface only D1 pointer rot, D2 semantic rot, or D3 uncaptured interpretation. Do not
     rewrite an ADR or README to resolve it; the ledger is the only possible approved write target.
4. When the runtime supports parallel inspection, inspect independent layers and the corpus-driven
   DDD and glossary detectors concurrently. Otherwise inspect sequentially. Detection is always
   read-only.

## Report before writes

Return a Japanese, layer-grouped report before proposing edits:

Do not write anything until the user selects a resolution for each finding. If the report has no findings, say which layers and categories were checked.

## Applying approved documentation changes

Only apply a README or Codex-skill change after the user explicitly approves that individual finding. Before writing, present the intended diff and explain why it preserves the authority order.

- Never edit implementation code, generated files, or `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep edits limited to the affected canonical English README or `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`;
  for an individually approved D finding, `.agents/ddd-audit/pattern-ledger.yaml` is also allowed.
- Never resolve a D finding by rewriting an ADR or README. Surface that desired decision-record
  change as follow-up for the user.
- For a proposed code correction, report the task instead of implementing it.
- Preserve the detector's E1/E2 split. E1 is eligible for the usual individual approval because it
  is a layer README. E2 (an ADR or `docs/rules.md`) is report-only: never ask for approval and never
  edit it. Never resolve E2 by editing `docs/spec/glossary.md`; vocabulary maintenance belongs to
  `glossary`, and deleting a term to silence a finding destroys its definition. Never edit
  `.agents/glossary-drift/exclusions.yaml`; declaring an exclusion is a user judgment, not a way for
  the detector or integrator to silence itself.
- After documentation edits, run `make md-lint`; if needed, run `make md-fix` only on the approved Markdown changes, then rerun the lint.

## Completion

Report each finding as approved, rejected, deferred to code work, or ignored; always keep E2 and
suppressed E findings visibly report-only. State all files changed and the Markdown validation result.
Do not stage, commit, or push.
