description: >-
  Create, update, evaluate, and optimize skills under this repository's `.codex/skills/`, carrying this repo's conventions for them (English-canonical SKILL.md + mandatory `SKILL.ja.md` translation pair, dense "pushy" description frontmatter, AGENTS.md scope + hard-protected paths, eval artifacts kept out of version control). This is the single entry point for ANY change to an existing skill under `.codex/skills/`; ALWAYS use it before hand-editing a `SKILL.md` or `SKILL.ja.md`. Use this WHENEVER the user wants to update / modify / change / edit / fix / improve / refactor / rename / extend / adjust / tune an existing skill — its steps, `description`, frontmatter, or behavior — or to build a new skill, author/scaffold a `/<name>` command, turn a repeated workflow into a skill, tune a skill's triggering description, or run evals/benchmarks on a skill — even if they don't say the word "skill-creator". Japanese triggers also apply, e.g. 「スキルを更新したい」「スキルを修正して」「このスキルの手順 / description / 挙動を変えて」. Do NOT use it for editing canonical docs (`docs/**`, per-package `README.md` — those have `sync-readme` / `canonicalize-doc` / `back-prop`), other AI-tool configs (`.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, Copilot), or generated files.

# Manage Skill

You have been invoked via `/manage-skill`. Argument string: `$ARGUMENTS`.

This skill authors and maintains skills under `.codex/skills/` for **this** repository. It carries
both halves of the job: the methodology (draft → test → review → improve → optionally optimize the
description) and the repository's own conventions, so the produced skill fits in alongside `commit`,
`new-env`, `canonicalize-doc`, and the rest. An external methodology plugin, when one is installed,
supplements it — see Step 0; nothing here depends on that.

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory
(not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- Create a brand-new skill / `/<name>` command, or turn a repeated workflow from the current
  conversation into one.
- Update, modify, improve, refactor, rename, extend, or fix an existing skill under
  `.codex/skills/` — this is the entry point for any such change, used before hand-editing a
  `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.ja.md`.
- Optimize a skill's `description` for better triggering, or run evals/benchmarks on a skill.

Do NOT use it for:

- Editing canonical docs (`docs/**`, per-package `README.md`) — those have their own flows
  (`sync-readme`, `canonicalize-doc`, `back-prop`).
- Other AI-tool configs (`.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) — out of scope
  per `AGENTS.md`.

## Scope note (AGENTS.md)

`AGENTS.md` normally treats `.codex/**` as out of scope. **Invoking this skill is the explicit user
instruction that relaxes that** — but only for `.codex/skills/**`, and only for the duration of this
run. The hard-protected paths from `AGENTS.md` stay protected even here: never touch `AGENTS.md`,
generated files (`**/*.gen.go`, `*.sql.go`, `*_mock.go`, `**/openapi.gen.yaml`), or generated
`docs/` content.

## Step 0 — Resolve optional external methodology (do this first)

Codex CLI can manage plugins through `codex plugin marketplace` and `codex plugin add`, but this
repository does not declare a marketplace or install `skill-creator` at project scope. Do not assume
that an external methodology is available, and do not run a bootstrap script.

Inspect the installed and available plugin entries first:

```bash
codex plugin list
```

If the output identifies an installed `skill-creator` plugin, read the `SKILL.md` from the exact path
reported in its `PATH` column and use its methodology as an optional supplement. Repository rules in
this skill remain authoritative on conflict.

If `skill-creator` is listed but not installed, ask the user before installing anything. After explicit
approval, install the exact plugin selector that `codex plugin list` reported:

```bash
codex plugin add <plugin@marketplace>
```

If no installed `skill-creator` is available, continue with this skill's self-contained workflow:
capture the intent, inspect comparable repository skills, write or revise the canonical skill, review
it against concrete invocation cases, and improve it before final validation. Do not add a marketplace
or install a plugin as an implicit prerequisite.

## The repository workflow

Apply the following repository rules whether or not an optional external methodology is available.

### 1. Placement and structure

- New skills live at `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `<name>` in kebab-case matching the `name:`
  frontmatter. Look at neighbors first (`commit`, `new-env`, `canonicalize-doc`, the `scaffold-*`
  family, the integrator `arch-check` / `back-prop`) and prefer editing/extending an existing skill
  over adding a near-duplicate.
- Bundled resources (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`) follow the same layout the existing skills use.
  Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines and push detail into `references/` with clear pointers.

### 2. Frontmatter conventions (match the existing skills)

- `name`: kebab-case, equal to the directory name.
- `description`: **one dense paragraph**, English, written to trigger reliably
  (state what it does AND concrete when-to-use contexts, plus explicit *when NOT* to trigger). Study
  the descriptions of `commit` / `new-env` for the density and tone this repo uses — match it.
- Optional: `argument-hint` and `allowed-tools` when the skill is a `/command` that takes args or runs
  a fixed tool set (see `commit` for the pattern). Omit them when not needed (most skills do).

### 3. Language rules (`AGENTS.md`)

- `SKILL.md` is **English canonical** — its body is written in imperative English, like every existing
  skill here. Do not write the canonical `SKILL.md` in Japanese.
- But the skill's *runtime behavior* must obey `AGENTS.md`: all user-visible output the skill produces
  (responses, generated code comments, test case names, PR/commit text) must be **Japanese**. When
  authoring a skill, bake that requirement into its instructions.

### 4. Mandatory Japanese translation pair

Every skill in this repo ships a `SKILL.ja.md` reference translation next to `SKILL.md`. This is not
optional here. After the canonical `SKILL.md` is finalized (create) or changed (update):

- Chain the `canonicalize-doc` skill to produce/sync `SKILL.ja.md` from the canonical `SKILL.md`.
- The translation carries the standard sync-note header and is not itself loaded as a skill. Confirm
  the pair is in sync before considering the task done.

### 5. Eval artifacts stay out of version control

Evaluation writes a `<skill-name>-workspace/` with iteration/eval dirs, benchmarks, and viewer
output. A sibling of the skill directory would land inside the tracked `.codex/skills/**`.
**Override the location**: put the workspace under the repo's gitignored `tmp/` (e.g.
`tmp/skills/manage-skill/<skill-name>-workspace/`), consistent with this repo's work-artifact convention
(plans/artifacts live outside git; `tmp/` is ignored). Never commit eval runs, benchmarks, feedback
JSON, or viewer HTML.

### 6. Reuse repo patterns when they fit the skill's shape

- If the new skill fans out read-only analysis across layers, mirror the **integrator + per-layer
  subagent** pattern (`arch-check` / `back-prop` spawn `*-auditor-*` / `*-detector-*` agents in
  parallel; the integrator does the single-threaded writes). Reuse existing subagent types rather than
  inventing new ones where possible.
- If the skill has a deterministic multi-step flow gated on user choices, use `ask the user explicitly` for the
  gates like `new-env` / `commit` do, rather than free-text prompts.
- Read the target layer's `README.md` / `docs/` **at runtime as the source of truth** (the `arch-*`,
  `test-review`, `scaffold-*` skills all do this) instead of hardcoding rules that will drift.

## Creating a new skill

Capture the intent, identify concrete invocation cases, write `SKILL.md`, and review the draft against
those cases. Then apply the repository workflow: correct placement, matching frontmatter/description
density, English-canonical body, and the eval workspace under `tmp/`. When the draft stabilizes,
generate `SKILL.ja.md` via `canonicalize-doc`.

## Updating an existing skill

- Confirm which skill (`.codex/skills/<name>/`). Preserve its `name` and directory unchanged.
- Unlike an *installed* plugin skill, repo skills are writeable in place — **edit them directly** under
  `.codex/skills/<name>/`; there is no read-only copy-to-`/tmp` dance.
- For a material behavior change, snapshot the pre-edit skill into `tmp/` and compare representative
  invocation cases before and after the update.
- After editing, re-sync `SKILL.ja.md` via `canonicalize-doc` — an updated `SKILL.md` with a stale
  Japanese pair is drift.

## Evaluating / optimizing

Evaluate the revised skill against representative invocation cases and review whether its description
triggers for intended requests without capturing excluded requests. Keep any comparison artifacts under
`tmp/` (§5). If an installed `skill-creator` provides a compatible evaluation or description-optimization
workflow, it may supplement this review.

## Definition of Done

- The self-contained workflow was followed: intent captured, representative invocation cases reviewed,
  and the draft improved before validation.
- `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` present, kebab `name` = dir, dense English "pushy" `description`.
- `SKILL.ja.md` generated/synced from the canonical `SKILL.md` and in sync.
- No eval artifacts committed (workspace under gitignored `tmp/`).
- No hard-protected path touched; only `.codex/skills/**` modified.
- The user has reviewed outputs (viewer or inline) and is satisfied.
- For every new or materially changed skill that is not platform-only, invoke `sync-ai` after local
  validation with this environment as the source. Pass the transfer contract to the receiving
  environment's `manage-skill`. When this invocation is itself the receiving child operation, do
  not invoke `sync-ai` again.
- `make md-skill-lint` passes. It mechanically enforces the existence aspect of the preceding
  `sync-ai` requirement: a skill present in only one environment fails. To declare one deliberately
  platform-only, follow the [Skill Lint section](../../../scripts/README.md#skill-lint) of
  `scripts/README.md`.
