description: Integrator skill that creates the 2-layer spec set for one feature — `docs/spec/domain/<pkgpath>.md` + `docs/spec/usecase/<pkgpath>.md` — by chaining per-layer skills (`new-spec-domain` / `new-spec-usecase`). lean A 構成では controller / infra に spec を持たず OpenAPI + sqlc gen + 命名規約から導出するため、spec は domain + usecase の 2 ファイルだけ。Confirms feature name (kebab-case, the bundle label) once via `ask the user explicitly`, then asks which layers to scaffold (multi-select, default both) and the per-layer package path each spec is filed under — the two paths are independent, since a usecase package and the aggregate it depends on rarely share a path — and chains the selected per-layer skills in dependency order (`domain` → `usecase`). Each per-layer skill still collects its own layer-specific identity (aggregate / interface name) and writes a Markdown file with YAML code-block placeholders and TODO markers. Skips layers whose target file already exists rather than aborting the chain. Use a per-layer skill (`new-spec-<layer>`) directly when scaffolding a single layer template. Does not invent business content — gathers identity only. All structural section definitions are read from `.codex/scaffold-spec/<layer>-spec.md` at runtime by each per-layer skill, so spec format changes propagate automatically.

# New Spec

Integrator for creating the 2-layer spec template set for one feature (lean A: one domain spec + one usecase spec).

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory (not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

## When to Use

- Starting a brand-new feature and want both spec templates created in one chained flow.
- A feature already has one of its two specs and you want to add the missing one.

Do NOT use this skill for:

- Creating a single layer template — invoke the matching per-layer skill directly:
  - `new-spec-domain` / `new-spec-usecase`
- Editing existing spec files — open in the editor.
- Generating Go code from spec — that's `scaffold-endpoint` (or per-layer `scaffold-<layer>`).
- Validating spec consistency — that's `verify-spec`.

## Why only 2 specs (lean A)

controller / infra layers are not spec-driven — they are derived at scaffold time from OpenAPI gen and sqlc gen, and the convention is enforced by `arch-check`. Full rationale: `.codex/scaffold-spec/lifecycle.md`.

## What This Skill Reads / Writes

This skill itself **does not read or write spec files directly**. All structural work is delegated to per-layer skills, each of which:

- Reads its matching `.codex/scaffold-spec/<layer>-spec.md` at runtime for the section list.
- Asks for layer-specific identity via its own `ask the user explicitly`.
- Writes one Markdown file under `docs/spec/domain/` or `docs/spec/usecase/`.

This skill is purely orchestration: it confirms the feature name, the layer selection and the per-layer package paths, then invokes per-layer skills in dependency order.

**A feature is a bundle, not a directory.** The spec tree is keyed by package path (`docs/spec/<layer>/<rest>.md` ⇔ `internal/<layer>/<rest>`), so the two specs of one feature sit in two different trees and need not share a path — `internal/usecase/user/search` is one feature with `internal/domain/user`. The feature name this skill collects labels the bundle and fills the glossary's Owner column; it never decides a file location.

## First Step: Confirm Feature and Layer Selection

This skill **MUST call `ask the user explicitly` immediately after invocation**. Start with one batched call carrying these two questions:

### Question 1: Feature name

- Free-text: 「feature 名（kebab-case）。例: `user-management`, `order-fulfillment`」
- Validate `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`. Re-ask on invalid input.
- This is the bundle label — it names the feature in the report and in the glossary's Owner column. It is **not** a path.

### Question 2: Layers to scaffold

- Multi-select, 2 options:
  - 「domain」
  - 「usecase」
- Default: both. The user may deselect either (e.g., the domain spec already exists and only the usecase one is needed).

### Then: the package path per selected layer

A second batched `ask the user explicitly`, one free-text question per selected layer, because the paths are what the skip check needs and they are not derivable from the feature name:

- domain: 「domain パッケージパス（`internal/domain/` 以下）。例: `cart`, `product/category`」
- usecase: 「usecase パッケージパス（`internal/usecase/` 以下）。例: `address`, `product/ranking`, `user/search`」

Validate each with `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(/[a-z][a-z0-9]*)*$` — Go package names carry no hyphens, so the kebab-case feature name is usually **not** a valid package path. Default each to the feature name with `-` replaced by `/` and let the user correct it.

After the answers come back:

1. Build the work plan: feature name + ordered list of (layer, package path) pairs to scaffold (dependency order: `domain` → `usecase`).
2. For each selected layer, check whether `docs/spec/<layer>/<pkgpath>.md` already exists. If it does, mark it as **skip** rather than failing the entire chain.
3. Show the plan in Japanese with skip markers, then confirm via `ask the user explicitly`:
   - Question: 「以下の順番で per-layer skill を chain します。進めますか？」
   - Options: 「進める」 / 「キャンセル」

If after applying skips the executable list is empty, report it and stop:

```text
全 layer の spec ファイルが既に存在します。実行対象がありません。
```

## Step 1. Chain Per-Layer Skills in Dependency Order

For each layer remaining in the plan (in order `domain` → `usecase`):

1. Invoke the matching skill: `new-spec-<layer>` via the `Skill` tool.
2. Pass the feature name **and that layer's package path** in the chain context so the child skill can skip its own path `ask the user explicitly` and only ask for layer-specific identity (aggregate name / interface name).
3. The child still asks the user to confirm and writes its own file.
4. If the child reports failure (e.g., user cancels the per-layer confirmation), stop the chain and surface the status; do NOT auto-rollback already-written layers.

Each per-layer skill is independent — they only share the feature name and the layer-execution order. Their package paths are separate answers, and they do not pass aggregate or interface names between each other.

## Step 2. Closing Report

After all selected layers have been processed (chain completed or stopped early), print a Japanese summary:

```text
new-spec 完了（feature: <feature>）。
  ✓ domain   : 作成済み (docs/spec/domain/<domainPkgPath>.md)
  ✓ usecase  : 作成済み (docs/spec/usecase/<usecasePkgPath>.md)

次のアクション:
  - editor で TODO を埋める
  - 2 spec 揃ったら verify-spec で format / 派生元 / cross-layer 参照を検証
  - 検証通過後に scaffold-endpoint で実装一括生成
    (controller / infra は OpenAPI / sqlc gen から自動導出される)
```

Adjust marks per actual result:

- ✓ = newly created
- `-` = skipped (file already existed)
- ✗ = failed / cancelled

Do NOT commit. Do NOT trigger any scaffold skill automatically.

## AI Modification Scope

This skill itself writes no files. All write scope is delegated to per-layer skills, each scoped to `docs/spec/<layer>/<pkgpath>.md`.

## Constraints

- ❌ Write spec files directly (always delegate to per-layer skills)
- ❌ Hardcode section lists (per-layer skills read `.codex/scaffold-spec/<layer>-spec.md` at runtime)
- ❌ Abort the entire chain because one layer's file already exists — mark as skip and continue
- ❌ Auto-rollback earlier created layers if a later layer fails
- ❌ Skip the feature-confirmation `ask the user explicitly`
- ❌ Derive a layer's package path from the feature name without asking (kebab-case is not a package path, and the two layers' paths differ)
- ❌ Run per-layer skills out of dependency order
- ❌ Offer controller / infra as spec options (lean A: those layers are derived, not spec-driven)
- ✅ Japanese user-facing output
- ✅ Multi-select layer choice (domain / usecase) with both default
- ✅ Chain in dependency order: `domain` → `usecase`
- ✅ Surface skip / fail status per layer in the final report
