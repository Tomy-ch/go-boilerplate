description: Create or synchronize a canonical English Markdown document and its Japanese translation. Use for `README.md`/`README.ja.md`, `SKILL.md`/`SKILL.ja.md`, generic co-located `*.ja.md` pairs, or the same pairs under `docs/`. Confirm the source and direction when they are not explicit, preserve technical tokens and structure, and modify only the selected pair.

# Canonical Document Sync

English is canonical; Japanese is a translation. Work on exactly one confirmed document pair.

## Resolve the pair

Accept a supplied file path and direction. If either is absent or ambiguous, inspect only the surrounding paths and ask the user to specify:

- source file;
- direction: `canonical-from-translation`, `translation-from-canonical`, or `sync-both`;
- for `sync-both`, which file is authoritative.

Supported mappings:

| Document type | Canonical | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| co-located README/generic Markdown | `foo.md` | `foo.ja.md` |
| skill | `SKILL.md` | `SKILL.ja.md` |
| documentation tree | `docs/<path>/foo.md` | `docs/<path>/foo.ja.md` |

Do not proceed if the pair cannot be determined safely.

## Translate or synchronize

1. Read the source file completely; for `sync-both`, read both files.
2. Preserve heading hierarchy, list nesting, link destinations, identifiers, paths, commands, and code blocks. Translate prose only.
3. For a canonical `SKILL.md`, keep valid English `name` and `description` frontmatter. Add a brief pointer to `SKILL.ja.md` when the translation exists.
4. For `SKILL.ja.md`, omit YAML frontmatter and begin with a Japanese blockquote stating it is a translation maintained from `SKILL.md` and should not be edited independently.
5. For README and generic translations, begin with a concise note that the English counterpart is canonical. Add a link from the English side only when requested.

## Write and verify

- Modify only the confirmed source/counterpart pair. Never modify `AGENTS.md`, generated content, or unrelated Markdown.
- Compare the final heading structure and section count. Code blocks must remain byte-identical except for intentional natural-language prose inside them.
- Run `make md-lint` after writing. Do not run repository-wide `make md-fix` without explicit approval because it may change unrelated files.
- Report unmapped sections or translation uncertainty instead of guessing.

State the source, direction, files changed, and Markdown lint result. Do not stage, commit, or push.
