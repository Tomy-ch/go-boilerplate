# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory holds the project's **architecture decisions**, one immutable record per
file, in [MADR-lite](https://adr.github.io/madr/) form. It supersedes the former monolithic
`docs/decisions.md` (now a redirect stub).

An ADR captures a single decision at a point in time: the context, the options weighed,
the choice, and its consequences. Superseding a decision does **not** mean editing its
ADR — it means adding a *new* ADR whose `Status` is `accepted` and marking the old one
`superseded`. The record of *why we once chose X* is preserved.

## What belongs here (and what does not)

| Kind | Example | Home |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **decision** — a choice among alternatives with lasting consequences | "Adopt onion architecture" | this dir (ADR) |
| **exclusion** — a deliberate "we intentionally do NOT do X" | "No in-application rate limiter" | this dir (ADR) |
| **rule** — a day-to-day enforced constraint / consequence of a decision | "Controller must not import infrastructure" | `docs/rules.md` (may link an ADR) |
| **inventory** — a catalog that drifts with the code | the direct-dependency table | `docs/reference/dependencies.md` (living doc) |

The dependency inventory is **not** an ADR: it tracks `go.mod` and changes continuously,
which is the opposite of an immutable record. The *policy* for selecting dependencies is
a decision (an ADR); the *list* of them is a living reference.

## Conventions

- **Filename**: `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, zero-padded 4 digits. Supersession frees no number — a superseded ADR keeps both its number and its file — so a retired decision's number is never handed to a different one.
- **Ordering**: append each new ADR at the next unused number. The number is a stable reference; use the title, tags, and the log to find the applicable decision. This is the general ADR practice described by [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html) and [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/architect-role/architecture-decision-record): preserve accepted records and express a replacement through a later ADR, rather than rearranging the historical sequence for thematic neatness.
- **References**: write `ADR-NNNN (kebab-title)`. The number identifies the current record and the slug detects a silent retarget after an upstream renumbering; `make md-doc-ref-lint` validates both against the filename.
<!-- boilerplate-only:begin -->
- **Upstream ordering exception**: while this repository is distributed as the boilerplate source, numbers follow dependency / foundational order (principles → contract → layers → subsystems → cross-cutting → exclusions), not discovery order. To preserve this order, a new ADR may be **inserted at its thematic position by shifting all subsequent numbers +1** (a pure renumbering: every shifted ADR keeps its content, and all repository-internal references are updated in the same change). This exception is removed when setup creates a project; the kebab title remains the stable identifier across an upstream renumbering.
<!-- boilerplate-only:end -->
- **Status lifecycle**: `proposed` → `accepted` → (`superseded` | `deprecated`).
- **Who may change a decision record**: superseding or deprecating an `accepted` ADR is a decision for this repository's architect or tech lead, taken per change. Finding that an accepted ADR is contradicted by the implementation is a reason to raise it with them, not a licence to change it — the implementation is as likely to be the error. A previous change is not standing authorization for the next.
- **Template**: copy [`template.md`](template.md).
- **Meta**: [`0000-record-architecture-decisions.md`](0000-record-architecture-decisions.md) records the decision to use ADRs and this classification.
- **Translation**: each ADR has a `<name>.ja.md` beside it (via the `canonicalize-doc` flow).
- **Upstream deviations**: while this repository is distributed as a boilerplate it operates under exceptions to the above, recorded in [`docs/get-started/boilerplate-only-conventions.md`](../get-started/boilerplate-only-conventions.md). They do not apply to a project built from it. <!-- boilerplate-only:line -->

## Log

All decisions from `docs/decisions.md` and the latent decisions across the repository have
been materialized as ADRs.

<!-- boilerplate-only:begin -->
Upstream numbering follows dependency / foundational order (principles → contract → HTTP →
persistence → DI/config → async subsystems → observability → toolchain/CI → process →
binary/deploy → exclusions).

Exclusion ADRs (deliberate "we do NOT do X") are tagged `setup-review` so the repository-setup flow
can enumerate them. The tag has no reader once setup is done.
