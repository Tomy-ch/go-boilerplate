# Security Posture

日本語: [security.ja.md](../ja/design/security.ja.md)

This document records **how security controls in this repository are reasoned about** — what
they assume, what each one is actually for, and where each one fires. It does not enumerate
the tools; that inventory lives in [`.github/workflows/README.md`](../../.github/workflows/README.md)
and drifts with the code. What is recorded here is the part that should *not* drift.

It covers three surfaces, in the order a risk reaches them: what CI **executes** (build
inputs), what the application **links** (dependencies), and what the running service **does
with a request** (application runtime). The mechanics of identity verification are a separate
concern with their own reference — see [auth.md](auth.md); what appears here is only where
authentication sits in the enforcement model.

## Threat model

Every control below is shaped by one assumption, and it is worth stating plainly because the
shape stops making sense without it:

> **The people with commit access to this repository are an internal team whose members are known
> to each other.**

That assumption buys something specific: **attribution is a usable deterrent**. A control does
not have to be technically unbypassable to work, as long as a bypass is visible and traceable
to a person. The organisation supplies the consequence; the repository supplies the evidence.

It also means a whole class of attack is deliberately **out of scope**. Someone with commit
access who intends harm can delete a workflow, edit a lockfile, and change the very check that
would have caught them — all in the same pull request. No amount of CI defends against that,
and pretending otherwise produces theatre: checks that look protective, cost maintenance, and
stop nothing. Where a control cannot prevent, this repository says so and settles for
detecting.

A repository that operates under different assumptions — public contributions, untrusted
committers, regulatory obligation — should revisit this document first, then the controls. Several of them
would need to become fail-closed.

## Three kinds of control

Conflating these is the most common way a security setup becomes both annoying and useless.
Each mechanism here is exactly one of the three, on purpose.

| Kind | What it does | Failure mode when misapplied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enforcement** | Refuses the action. Fail-closed. | Blocks legitimate emergency work; gets disabled |
| **Detection** | Lets the action through, records it, makes it attributable | Mistaken for protection; nobody reads the record |
| **Deterrence** | Organisational consequence, informed by detection | Assumed to exist without evidence to act on |

Where each mechanism sits:

| Mechanism | Kind | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pin-actions-check` / `pin-images-check` | Enforcement | Fail-closed: an unpinned or unregistered reference is an error |
| `egress-check` | Enforcement | Fail-closed: an inline `allowed-endpoints` that has drifted from `.github/egress.toml` is an error |
| Release gates (`trivy-release-gate` / `osv-release-gate`) | Enforcement | Only on PRs into a deploy branch |
| `dependency-review` | Enforcement | Evaluates only what the PR *adds* |
| Secret scans (gitleaks / TruffleHog) | Enforcement | A committed secret is never an acceptable trade |
| `zizmor` | Enforcement | High severity only; exceptions are file-scoped in `.github/zizmor.yml`. Also gates pre-commit, offline audits only |
| Reporting scanners (`trivy-fs` / `osv-scanner` / `govulncheck` / CodeQL) | Detection | Findings reach code scanning and the PR, but do not block |
| `npm-cooldown-audit` | Detection | Non-blocking by construction — see below |
| `harden-runner` (`egress-policy: block`) | Enforcement | Refuses any egress outside the job's `allowed-endpoints`; `trufflehog` alone stays on `audit` |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Enforcement | The review requirement behind "this decision belongs to a role" |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Detection | Posture measurement, no verdict |

## Where a control fires

A control that runs everywhere is a control nobody reads. Each trigger answers a different
question, and a mechanism belongs where its question is actually being asked:

| Trigger | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| Pull request | *Does this change make things worse?* |
| Push to a protected branch | Keeps a code-scanning baseline for branch protection to judge |
| PR into `develop` / `staging` / `production` | *Is what we are about to promote acceptable?* |
| Weekly schedule | *Did the world change while the code stood still?* — new CVEs, new queries, newly archived actions |

The consequence worth internalising: **a scheduled run only exists for a tool whose result can
change without the code changing.** Everything else is noise on a timer.

### Why reporting and gating are split

An ordinary PR reports; a promotion PR gates. The reasoning is in
[ADR-0086 (multi-layer-security-scanning)](../adr/0086-multi-layer-security-scanning.md), and reduces to this: a vulnerability
inherited from the existing dependency tree is not something the current PR introduced, and
not something its author can fix. Blocking there turns every unrelated change red until an
upstream fix lands elsewhere. The predictable outcome is that the check gets disabled or
routinely merged past — which costs more than the gate was worth.

Suppressing the finding instead (`ignore-unfixed`, an ID allowlist) trades one failure for
another: it also silences the finding at promotion time, which is the one moment it mattered.
The split keeps the signal in both places and puts the *verdict* where someone can act on it.

## Build inputs

What CI *executes* is a different risk from what the application *links*. Actions and base
images run with the job's credentials before any of our code does, so they are pinned harder.

**A version reference is not an identity.** A tag can be re-pointed and a mutable image tag can
be rebuilt, so the version stays in the source as human-readable intent while an immutable
digest lives in a lockfile that is the single source of truth —
`.github/actions-pin.toml` ([ADR-0087 (sha-pinned-actions)](../adr/0087-sha-pinned-actions.md)) and
`docker/images-pin.toml`. Both checks are fail-closed, and unpinned versus unregistered are
distinct errors so neither degrades into the other.

**The quarantine buys time; it does not verify a date.** An action's age is taken as the *newer*
of its release publication date and its resolved commit date. Neither alone is trustworthy: a
release object is bound to the tag *name*, so its publication date survives the tag being
re-pointed — the exact threat the quarantine exists for — while a commit date can be set to any
past instant by the committer. Taking the newer of the two means the quarantine holds as long as
either says the target is new, but it is a delay against automated takeover, not a defence
against a forged date. Detecting the re-point itself is the lockfile's job: the resolved digest
changes, the diff is small, and a human reads it.

**A `docker://` step reference belongs to the image lockfile, not the action one.** A workflow may
run a container directly (`uses: docker://<image>[:<tag>|@<digest>]`), which is a registry
reference rather than a GitHub repository. `pin-actions` resolves a ref to a commit SHA through
`git ls-remote`, an operation that has no meaning for a registry, so it treats `docker://` as out
of scope the same way it treats a local `./` reference — forcing it through would either fabricate
a repository name or duplicate the digest resolution `docker/images-pin.toml` already owns. No
`docker://` reference exists under `.github/**` today; pinning one means widening the image
lockfile's scan to `.github/**`, never widening `pin-actions`.

## Dependencies

### Three principles that hold for every ecosystem

**A cooldown window is proportional to upstream's detection latency, not to blast radius.** A
compromised publish is usually caught and pulled within hours to days; the window exists to sit
out that interval. Where upstream detects and corrects quickly the window is shorter (npm: 7
days), and where remediation is slower it is longer (Actions and images: 14 days,
`PIN_ACTIONS_MIN_AGE_DAYS` / `PIN_IMAGES_MIN_AGE_DAYS`). The number is a policy input derived
from the ecosystem, not a constant to copy across them.

**The window is a proxy, and a proxy can be discharged by direct evidence.** Waiting N days is a
cheap stand-in for four questions: did the publisher change, does the artifact match its source,
what actually changed, and did new dependencies appear. When a fix is urgent those can be
answered directly — transparency-log lookup, artifact-versus-tag comparison, reading the diff,
checking the manifest for new requirements. Answering them beats counting days. Skipping *both*
does not.

**A prerelease is outside what the window measures.** The window buys time for upstream to notice
a bad publish and pull it. An alpha or beta is not a publish anyone intends to stand behind: it is
offered on the understanding that it may change shape or vanish, so surviving N days says nothing
about it. That makes "it cleared the cooldown" the wrong reason to take one. Prereleases therefore
stay out of the resolved tree unless a specific need names one, even where a dependency's own range
permits them — a range like `^1.7.1 || ^2.0.0-alpha.3` says the author will accept either, not that
the alpha is preferred, and a resolver picking the highest match will take the alpha every time.
Pinning back to the stable line is an `overrides` entry in the ecosystem's own config, carrying the
reason.

### Go modules

The Go ecosystem gives integrity almost for free, and offers nothing at all for freshness. Both
halves matter.

**Integrity is strong and on by default.** Every module version's hash is recorded in a public
transparency log (`sum.golang.org`) and checked against `go.sum` on download; a published
version is immutable in the proxy and cannot be withdrawn or silently swapped. Nothing in this
repository weakens that — there is no `GOFLAGS`, `GONOSUMDB`, `GOPRIVATE`, or `GOINSECURE`
override anywhere. `vendor/` is untracked, so build inputs are re-fetched and re-verified rather
than trusted from the tree.

**Freshness has no enforcement whatsoever.** There is no `min-release-age` equivalent: `go get`
will take a version published minutes ago without complaint. This inverts the npm situation in a
way worth internalising:

| | npm | Go modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cooldown enforced by the toolchain | Yes, at resolution | **No** |
| Can be bypassed | Yes, with a flag | Nothing to bypass |
| Bypass is detectable | Yes (`npm-cooldown-audit`) | **Nothing to detect** |
| Remaining control | Review + detection | **Review only** |

Because review is the only control here, `go.mod` and `go.sum` are in
[`CODEOWNERS`](../../.github/CODEOWNERS). That entry is load-bearing rather than symmetrical
bookkeeping: for npm a slip is caught after the fact, for Go it is not caught at all.

**Reachability filtering cuts both ways.** `govulncheck` reports only vulnerabilities the
application actually calls, which is what makes it trustworthy enough to act on. The cost is
coverage: an advisory the Go vulnerability database has not ingested yet produces no finding at
all, so a clean `govulncheck` says nothing about a GHSA published this week. Breadth is covered
separately by Trivy FS and OSV-Scanner, which match on version rather than call graph.

### npm

The cooldown is real but narrower than it looks: `min-release-age` is enforced while npm
**resolves**, and `npm ci` does not resolve — it replays the lockfile. Every CI job and image
build here uses `npm ci`.

Verified behaviour, not inference:

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Resolving an in-window version | Rejected (`ETARGET`) |
| Resolving a range whose newest match is in-window | Silently resolves to the newest *aged* version, exit 0 |
| Resolving with `--min-release-age=0` | Succeeds; the in-window version enters the lockfile |
| `npm ci` with an in-window entry already in the lockfile | Succeeds, no warning |
| `npm install` / adding a package, with that entry present | Succeeds; the entry is kept |

Two consequences. A deliberate override costs the team nothing — no member is blocked and no
workaround is needed. And it leaves no trace anywhere: not at image build, not in CI, and once
the window passes the entry is indistinguishable from a normally resolved one.

That is why `npm-cooldown-audit` exists, why it audits a **PR against its base** rather than only
scanning the current tree (an entry ages out of the window; the PR comment does not), and why it
**never fails the build**. Overriding the cooldown is a role's call — reacting to a CRITICAL
advisory is the case it exists for — so a hard gate would block precisely the legitimate use. The
non-blocking property is implemented in the tool itself rather than in workflow configuration, so
it cannot be turned into a gate by editing YAML.

**A transitive pin is provisional debt.** Forcing a patched version through `overrides` is
written as a same-major floor (`">=<fixed> <<next-major>"`), never an exact version: an exact pin
freezes the dependency where it is, so when the pinned version later gets its own advisory the
pin keeps forcing the now-vulnerable one. Every override is meant to be reclaimed once the parent
ships a release that pulls the fix natively.

### pnpm

Two packages resolve with pnpm — `scripts/` and `docs-viewer/` — each carrying its own
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The window is the same 7 days as npm and derived the
same way; pnpm states it in minutes, so `minimumReleaseAge: 10080`.

What differs is **where** the window is enforced, and it inverts npm's weakness. npm checks only
while it resolves, so an in-window entry that once reached the lockfile is invisible from then on.
pnpm re-verifies the **entire lockfile** against the active policies on every install — including
`--frozen-lockfile`, the replay path that `npm ci` leaves unchecked.

Verified behaviour, not inference:

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Resolving an exact in-window version, `minimumReleaseAgeStrict: true` | Rejected (`ERR_PNPM_NO_MATURE_MATCHING_VERSION`), naming the version, its publish time, and the cutoff |
| Resolving a range whose newest match is in-window | Silently resolves to the newest *aged* match, exit 0 |
| Resolving an exact in-window version, `minimumReleaseAgeStrict: false` | Succeeds — and pnpm writes the `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entry into `pnpm-workspace.yaml` itself |
| `--frozen-lockfile` replaying an in-window entry that no exclusion covers | Rejected (`ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION`) |
| Any `pnpm run` after a policy setting changed | Rejected (`ERR_PNPM_VERIFY_DEPS_BEFORE_RUN`) until `pnpm install` re-records the settings |

Three consequences follow, and together they are why pnpm needs no `npm-cooldown-audit`
counterpart: there is nothing to detect after the fact, because nothing gets through unrecorded.

**An override cannot be silent.** Taking an in-window version requires a
`minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entry, and without one every later install fails — CI included, since
its install is the frozen replay. The entry lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which is tracked and in
[`CODEOWNERS`](../../.github/CODEOWNERS), so the override is reviewed by construction rather than
reported by a bot afterwards.

**`minimumReleaseAgeStrict: true` is what keeps the override a human's.** With it off, pnpm writes
the exclusion itself and carries on — the resolver, not a person, decides to take a fresh publish.
Strict mode turns that into a stop, on the same reasoning that puts install-shaped commands in
`ask` rather than letting them run: the point of an override is that someone chose it.

**An exclusion is dated debt whose removal date is load-bearing in both directions.** Deleting the
entry before the window opens breaks every install; once the version ages past the cutoff the entry
is redundant and the lockfile passes without it. Each entry therefore records what it exempts, why,
where that package runs, and the date it becomes deletable.

An exclusion names `<package>@<version>`, never a bare package name: a name-only exemption would
excuse every future publish of that package, which is exactly what the window exists to catch. The
same rule governs `trustPolicyExclude`, whose subject is provenance regression rather than freshness.

One operational caveat: the lockfile verification result is cached (`Lockfile passes supply-chain
policies (verified 1m ago)`), so editing a policy does not always force a re-check on the very next
install.

### PyPI

Python tools are the one exception to `mise.toml` holding every tool version, and the reason is a
supply-chain one: pinning a PyPI tool's version pins almost nothing, because its dependency tree is
resolved at install time, so the same pin installs a different tree on different days. Each tool
therefore declares its version in `python/<tool>.in` and carries the resolved tree — every
transitive package, with sha256 hashes — in `python/<tool>.txt`
([ADR-0077 (mise-ssot-drift-gate)](../adr/0077-mise-ssot-drift-gate.md); `python/README.md` has the mechanics). Installs
are `uv pip install --require-hashes -r <tool>.txt`, which refuses any requirement lacking a version
or a hash, so integrity verification is part of installing rather than a step that can be skipped.

**The window is 7 days**, derived the way npm's is — PyPI detects and yanks a malicious publish
quickly, so the interval to sit out is short. A bump therefore takes the newest release already aged
past the window, not the newest release; when a pin deliberately trails it says so in a comment, and
`python/graphify.in` is the PyPI instance of that convention.

Freshness has no resolver-side enforcement here — `uv pip compile` will resolve a version published
minutes ago without complaint. What enforces it is a repository gate, `scripts/tool-cooldown`, and
unlike npm's audit-only counterpart it **fails the build**.

Verified behaviour, not inference:

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `gate` (a pull request's diff) adds or raises a declaration inside the window | Non-zero exit, naming the version, its age, and the bypass file |
| `audit` (full inventory) finds an in-window declaration | Reported as a warning, **exit 0** — it takes stock, it does not block |
| A `.in` declares a version its `.txt` does not pin | Non-zero exit in **both** `gate` and `audit` |
| Installing | `--require-hashes` refuses any requirement without a version and a hash |

The third row is what keeps the first two honest. The gate reads the declaration while the installer
reads the lockfile, so without that cross-check raising a `.in` and forgetting `make py-lock` would
clear the cooldown for a version that never gets installed, and say nothing about the one that does.
It is a structural fault rather than a cooldown finding, which is why it fails the inventory command
too.

The `gate` / `audit` split is the same one drawn under *Why reporting and gating are split*: `gate`
judges what a change introduces and can therefore block, while `audit` inventories what is already
there, where findings arrive as versions age rather than as anyone's edit.

**A bypass is dated debt.** `.github/tool-cooldown-bypass.toml` takes
`"<key>@<version>" = { expires, issue, reason }`, all three required. An entry that has expired, that
reaches more than three months out, or that no longer matches any declaration fails `gate` *and*
`audit`. The expiry arrives without anyone editing a file, which is why the check also runs on a
schedule instead of only on pull requests.

Two properties make freshness sharper here than for a library:

- **A tool runs with the developer's privileges**, not inside the service. A compromised release
  executes on a workstation that has repo write access and whatever credentials the shell holds.
- **Cadence can be high enough that the newest version is never aged.** `graphifyy` published 198
  releases in its first 117 days, so its pin trails by design; the comment saying so is the steady
  state rather than a one-off note.

Discharging the window early follows the general rule above — answer the four questions with
`/supply-chain-triage` instead of counting days. A tool that ships an **agent skill** adds one
question a library does not have: **what it sends off the machine, and on which commands.** Which
of `graphifyy`'s commands stay local and which reach an API is recorded in
[`.claude/README.md`](../../.claude/README.md), which also documents the local subset as the
default path. Its installer additionally writes user-scope agent config (`~/.claude/skills/`,
`~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — outside the repo, and therefore outside every gate
described here.

The same tool also ships subcommands that write **project** scope: `graphify claude install`
rewrites `CLAUDE.md`, `graphify codex install` rewrites `AGENTS.md`, and `graphify hook install`
installs git hooks and a merge driver. A skill an agent can invoke therefore has a documented path
to edit the very files that define what that agent may do, which is why those forms sit in
`settings.json` rather than in prose alone.

They sit in **`ask`, not `deny`**, and as **patterns, not names**. `ask` because the goal is that no
install happens without a human choosing it — not that installs are forbidden; a `deny` also blocks
the legitimate case, and the user issues "use this tool" and "install this tool" as separate
instructions (`AGENTS.md`, *Installing Things*). Patterns because the risky thing is the shape
`<something> install`, not the platform names that happened to exist when the list was written:
`graphify --help` grew to 20 `<platform> install` subcommands, and an enumeration written against an
earlier release silently stops covering the new ones. A gate that decays without telling anyone is
worse than a narrower gate that holds.

**A pin bump is therefore a review of the CLI surface, not just of the version number.** The window
and the triage above answer "is this release trustworthy"; they say nothing about "does this release
expose new commands that write to the repo". Read the new `--help` when raising the pin, and check
that the patterns still cover what it can write. This is the failure mode that produced the
enumeration gap in the first place — 198 releases in 117 days, each one able to add a subcommand.

## Application runtime

The controls above protect what enters the repository. These protect what the running service
does with a request. Three patterns repeat, and they are the part worth carrying forward rather
than rediscovering.

**Deny by default, at every boundary.** The outbound dial guard
(`internal/observability/http_client_transport.go`, [ADR-0022 (egress-ssrf-guard)](../adr/0022-egress-ssrf-guard.md))
refuses link-local, multicast, unspecified, and bogon destinations unconditionally, and refuses
loopback / private / CGNAT unless the caller opted in through the context — with the unset case
resolving to the safe `false`. Error-detail exposure
(`internal/controller/httpstack/errorhandler/detail_exposure.go`) is the same shape: route
mismatch, unresolved operation, empty `operationId`, and not-opted-in all evaluate to *deny*.
Neither control has a state where forgetting something opens it.

**The spec is the authority for the request boundary.** Request validation and authentication are
enforced at runtime from the OpenAPI document ([ADR-0015 (spec-driven-request-validation)](../adr/0015-spec-driven-request-validation.md)),
not from hand-written checks in handlers. The direct consequence is that **reviewing the spec
diff is reviewing the security posture** — an operation that omits its `security` requirement is
unprotected no matter how the handler is written, and no amount of Go review will surface it.
Business-validity rules are deliberately *not* here: the domain layer is their sole authority
([ADR-0016 (validation-value-authority)](../adr/0016-validation-value-authority.md)), so the two never drift into each other.

**Escape hatches are named, narrow, and greppable.** `ContextWithAllowPrivateNetwork`, the
`details` property that opts an error schema into detail exposure, and `/metrics` as a declared
auth exception ([ADR-0018 (metrics-endpoint-auth-exception)](../adr/0018-metrics-endpoint-auth-exception.md)) are each a specific
seam you can search for and enumerate. None of them is a general-purpose flag, because a general
flag becomes the thing everyone sets.

Two absences are deliberate rather than pending: there is no in-application rate limiter
([ADR-0101 (no-in-app-rate-limiter)](../adr/0101-no-in-app-rate-limiter.md)), and responses are not validated against the
spec ([ADR-0015 (spec-driven-request-validation)](../adr/0015-spec-driven-request-validation.md)). SQL injection is handled
structurally instead of by review — queries are generated by sqlc and therefore parameterised
([ADR-0024 (sqlc-type-safe-sql)](../adr/0024-sqlc-type-safe-sql.md)) — and `gosec` runs in the authoritative
golangci gate ([ADR-0081 (two-layer-golangci-config)](../adr/0081-two-layer-golangci-config.md)).

A detail worth copying rather than rediscovering: Go's `netip.Addr.IsPrivate` covers RFC1918 and
ULA but **not** CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), so the guard carries its own prefix check. Reimplementing
the dial guard from the standard library alone inherits that hole.

## Secrets

Two detectors, because a secret scanner can be wrong along two independent axes: it can fail to
recognise the shape, or it can flag a string that was never a live credential. gitleaks covers
pattern-shaped detection over the full history; TruffleHog reports only credentials it verified
against the issuing service.

One rule overrides convenience everywhere: **a detected secret's value never reaches a job log,
a PR comment, or an artifact.** Summaries carry detector name, path, line, and commit — never
the match itself. A leak report that leaks is worse than no report, because it publishes the
credential to a wider audience than the commit did.

## Honest limits

Worth stating so nobody builds on a stronger assumption than the controls support:

- `harden-runner` runs in `block` mode, and an allowlist is only as good as its accuracy. The
  lists are inferred from what each job does rather than measured, and they are generated from
  the SSOT in `.github/egress.toml` by capability class, so a class is wider than the narrowest
  job in it. One job — `trufflehog` — stays on `audit` deliberately: it verifies a candidate
  credential against an open-ended set of issuers, so a missing endpoint there would turn a real
  leak into an unverified result instead of a red build.
- Release gates only block if registered as **required status checks**. Without that branch
  protection rule they report and nothing more, and the reporting/gating split degrades to
  reporting everywhere.
- `CODEOWNERS` only enforces under the **"Require review from Code Owners"** rule; otherwise it
  merely auto-requests a reviewer.
- Detection reaches a PR comment and a run annotation. Both are passive, and the annotation
  disappears with the run's retention. Routing findings to a channel the owning role actually
  watches is tracked separately.
