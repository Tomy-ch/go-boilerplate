# Send the windows that have closed but never reached their feedback issue.
#
# This runs at SessionStart rather than SessionEnd, and the choice is deliberate. A window that
# has closed is complete and can be sent whenever; a session that is ending is the one moment the
# user wants the process gone, and a network call there hangs on the way out where nobody sees it
# fail. Deferring to the next start is also what the index already models — an entry with no
# feedback issue means "not sent yet", and the next start is the next chance. `/clear` closes a
# window and fires SessionStart in the same breath, so in practice a boundary sends almost at once.
#
# It sends only CLOSED windows. The one still open is incomplete, and half a window is worse than
# a late one.
#
# Everything here degrades to doing nothing. A missing runner, an unauthenticated `gh`, no network
# — each leaves the index untouched and the window pending, which is the state the next run reads.
# It must never block or fail a session, so it exits 0 unconditionally and runs
# the actual send in the background.
#
# Transcripts live under the user's home, which the tool-runner container cannot see; the path is
# therefore computed here by `transcripts_dir` and passed explicitly.

# Only one send at a time, for the same reason marks.sh locks its pointer: the index is
# read-modify-write, so two runs both see every pending window and both create an issue for it.
# Observed, with the reading done locally: 2 windows became 21 issues.
#
# `mkdir` is the primitive because it is atomic on every filesystem this runs on and needs no
# `flock`, which macOS does not ship.
#
# The lock is released on the normal path rather than only from a trap, because the trap does not
# fire on the one path that matters. `--hook` starts this as `( ... & )`, and in that doubly
# backgrounded form the EXIT trap is never reached — measured: the same function leaks its lock
# under `( f & )` and releases it under `( f ) &`. A leak there is permanent and silent, since
# every later run finds the directory and returns without sending anything.
#
# A stale lock is therefore taken over rather than trusted. Something that has held it for longer
# than any real send could take is not running any more, whatever happened to it. That is the
# right way round: a missed send is retried at the next start, while a stale lock stops every one
# of them and says nothing.
#
# A second, live run does not wait: it exits, because the run already in flight will send the same
# windows. Queueing would only pile up duplicates of that same work behind a call that must not
# block a session.

Usage:
  send.sh            Send closed, unsent windows (blocking; prints the result)
  send.sh --hook     Same, detached and silent (SessionStart)
  send.sh --dry-run  Print what would be sent, send nothing

Requires scripts/node_modules/.bin/tsx and an authenticated gh. Missing either is not an error:
the windows stay pending and the next run picks them up.
