  Compress an undecided design, technology, or operational question into a comparison a human can decide from — options scored on axes chosen for the question, a recommendation stated with its basis, and the conditions that would reverse it. Use whenever a choice is genuinely open and nobody has picked yet: which storage / library / pattern to use, where a responsibility belongs, whether to introduce an abstraction, how to shape a subsystem — 「A と B どっちが妥当？」「どう設計すべき？」「これって何を使うのが普通？」「選択肢を出して」. It starts by trying to dissolve the question rather than answer it: if an isomorphic mechanism already exists in this repository, placement and construction are already settled and there is no design branch to score, so it says so instead of manufacturing three options. When a branch is real it fixes the evaluation axes BEFORE enumerating options, so the axes cannot be reverse-engineered from a preferred answer, and it never fixes the option count — inventing a third option for a do-it / do-not question is how a comparison becomes theatre. It weighs everything for the reader this repository actually ships to, someone receiving the template snapshot who will never read its git log, and per `AGENTS.md` it states cost plainly without letting cost pick the answer. External claims carry publisher, date and URL; an unverifiable one is reported as unverified and lowers the confidence rather than being dressed up — it never invents a benchmark number or a citation. Read-only and decision-free: it produces `Decision required` and stops, because adopting an option, writing the ADR, and filing the issue are human calls. Do NOT use it to establish what the repository currently does (`repo-truth` first — a comparison built on a wrong premise is worse than none), to work an already-decided issue (`impl-issue`), to file the outcome (`new-issue`), or to review a diff (`impl-review`).

# Research

Turn an open question into a decision a human can actually make — or into the finding that it was
never open.

A Japanese reference translation lives at `SKILL.ja.md` in this directory (for human reference only;
not loaded as a skill).

## When to Use

- A design, technology, or operational choice is open and nobody has picked yet.
- Someone asks for options, or asks what the normal approach is.
- A decision is being reconsidered and needs its trade-offs laid out again.

Do NOT use it to establish what the repository currently does (`repo-truth` first), to work an
already-decided issue (`impl-issue`), to file the outcome (`new-issue`), or to review a diff
(`impl-review` / `test-review` / `comment-sweep`).

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | 未決の比較、評価軸の確定、推奨とその反転条件、決めるべきことの提示 |
| **Never** | 採択 / ADR 承認 / 実装 / 案数合わせの選択肢捏造 / 出典・数値の捏造 |
| **Starts when** | 選択が開いていて、まだ誰も決めていないとき |
| **Stops when** | 現状が不明（`repo-truth` へ）、既に ADR / spec が決めている、外部情報を確認できない |

## Why this exists

Three failure modes make a comparison worse than no comparison, and all three look like diligence.

**The axes get reverse-engineered from the answer.** Once a preferred option exists, the criteria
that favour it are the ones that get written down. Fixing the axes first is the only defence, and it
has to happen before any option is named.

**Cost picks the answer.** "That would mean touching 30 files" quietly becomes the deciding argument.
`AGENTS.md`'s *What to Recommend* section is explicit that on this repository quality and consistency
outrank the cost of reaching them, and that the cost is stated so a human can decline the scope while
keeping the direction. Stating the cost is required; letting it choose is not.

**Evidence gets manufactured.** A benchmark number, a version, a "commonly recommended" — each is
easy to produce and hard to notice as invented. An unverified claim in a comparison's confident
register becomes the basis of a decision nobody can trace back.

There is also a fourth thing this skill exists to prevent, which is subtler: **answering a question
that was never open.** See Step 1.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--stage=full` *(default)* | Run through to a recommendation |
| `--stage=dissolve` | Run Steps 0-1 only and stop — is it already decided, is there an isomorphic precedent? |
| `--sources=repo` | Repo evidence only; make no external claim rather than an unverified one |
| `--sources=external` *(default)* | External lookup permitted, cited per the Sources section |
| `--axes=<csv>` | The caller fixes the evaluation axes; Step 2 adopts them instead of choosing |

`--stage=dissolve` is the cheap mode and often the whole answer: most questions that arrive here are
either settled already or structurally identical to something the codebase solved. Reach for it when
the ask is "is this even an open question?" — and report the dissolution as a result, not as a failure
to compare.

`--sources=repo` is the honest mode when lookup is unavailable. It is not a degraded run; it is a run
that declines to guess, and it must say which claims it therefore could not make.

## Step 0 — Establish that the question is actually open

A comparison built on a wrong premise about the current code is worse than no comparison, because it
looks decidable.

Before anything else, establish the current state — what exists, what constrains it, whether a
decision already stands in `docs/adr/` or `docs/design/`. If that state is unclear or contested,
**stop and say so**: the user should run `repo-truth` first. Do not invoke it yourself and do not
paper over the gap with an assumption, because the assumption then silently shapes every option.

If an ADR or spec already decides this, that is the answer. Report it, note whether the reasoning
still holds, and stop. Re-opening a settled decision is a human's call — `AGENTS.md` is explicit that
a precedent is not an authorization.

**Look for that decision by concern, not by keyword.** There are 110 records under `docs/adr/`, and
`AGENTS.md` states plainly that searching the index for your feature's words is not enough, because a
document is named for the concern it owns. Read the entries in `docs/adr/README.md` and
`docs/design/README.md` and pick by what each one governs. A decision missed this way does not
surface as an error — it surfaces as a comparison that re-litigates something already settled, which
is the most expensive output this skill can produce.

## Step 1 — Look for an isomorphic mechanism first

Before treating this as a design question, check whether the repository already solves a structurally
identical problem somewhere else. When it does, placement, construction, and call-site are already
decided by that precedent, and scoring options would be inventing a branch that does not exist.

This is the cheapest step and the most frequently skipped one. Search the layer that would own the
new thing, then its siblings, then `pkg/`. Read `docs/architecture.md` and the owning `README.md` at
runtime rather than reasoning from the shape of the problem.

**An isomorphic mechanism is found by its shape, which means a keyword search will not find it.** It
solves a different domain problem with the same structure, so it shares no vocabulary with the
question — the precedent for a time window is a page cursor, and no search for "window" reaches it.
Enumerate what a layer actually contains and look at each one's shape; do not grep for the concept.

**This is what the graph is for.** Graphify indexes structure rather than text, so it reaches the
precedent that shares no words with the question — the one case where search is guaranteed to fail
and traversal is not. Read `.claude/README.md` for what pays off here, then enumerate the candidate
layer and traverse from the types that look structurally similar:

```bash
# What already depends on a candidate precedent — how load-bearing it is, and who its callers are.
node .claude/scripts/graph-affected.ts <symbol> --depth 2

# Structural lookup. Raise the budget; the default (~2000 tokens) truncates on a repo this size.
GRAPHIFY="${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/go-boilerplate/graphify/bin/graphify"
"$GRAPHIFY" query "<structural question>" --budget 8000
```

Confirm any candidate in source before calling it isomorphic — a graph edge shows a relation, not
that the two solve the same shape of problem. When the graph is absent or behind
(`Built from commit:` in `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` vs `git rev-parse HEAD`), say so, because a
structural sweep you could not run is part of what makes "no precedent" a weaker claim.

That asymmetry sets the burden of proof. "I found one" is verifiable by inspection, so it needs no
frontier. "There is none" is a claim about 150 packages you did not open, so say which layers were
enumerated — and if the sweep was partial, present the options as *provisional pending that check*
rather than asserting the branch is real.

Say plainly when it applies:

> 設計分岐なし。`<X>` は既存の `<Y>` と同型で、配置・構築・呼び出し位置はそちらの前例で確定する。

Scoring axes are what you reach for when this step finds nothing — and finding nothing is a claim
that has to be earned, because manufacturing a design branch that the codebase already settled is
exactly the failure this step exists to prevent.

## Step 2 — Fix the evaluation axes, then stop touching them

Choose the axes for *this* question and write them down before naming a single option.

This repository has a precedent worth starting from — 業界的正しさ / DDD 整合性 / アーキテクチャ純粋性
/ template 先の純粋性 — and it is a starting point, not a fixed rubric. A question about a build gate
does not have a DDD axis; a question about vocabulary is almost entirely the DDD one. Pick what the
question actually turns on, and say why each axis is there.

The last of those four is the one most easily forgotten and most often decisive: **this repository's
product is the state a project receives at `useTemplate` time**, not the history that produced it.
Weigh each option for someone who has never seen this repository and will never read its git log.
`AGENTS.md`'s *What to Recommend* section governs this.

## Step 3 — Enumerate options — the count is not the point

Enumerate the options the question actually has. Three is a common number and not a requirement:
a do-it / do-not question has two, and inventing a third to fill the shape produces a straw man that
makes the comparison look more considered than it is. A question with five genuinely distinct
approaches gets five; compress by merging near-duplicates, never by dropping one that differs.

Per option, and against the axes fixed in Step 2:

| Field | What it must contain |
| --- | --- |
| 案 | A name that says what it is, not "案 A" |
| 利点 / 欠点 | Consequences, not adjectives |
| リスク | Failure mode, migration, operational burden, security, lock-in |
| 既存構造との整合 | Which layer owns it, which rule in `docs/rules.md` it touches, what it forces elsewhere |
| コスト | Files touched, what breaks for whom, what must be regenerated — stated, never weighted into the verdict |

An unmeasured cost is not a trade-off, it is a guess. "Adds a read on the hot path" is checkable —
count the queries in both designs, or drop the claim. The same applies to blast radius: "touches
about 30 files" is a number the graph produces rather than estimates, so reverse-traverse from the
symbols each option would change (`node .claude/scripts/graph-affected.ts <symbol> --depth 2`) and
report what it returned.

## Step 4 — Recommend, and say what would reverse it

**Give a recommendation.** A comparison handed over without one returns the work to the person who
asked; on this repository the expectation is that the recommendation arrives with the options, not
after being asked for.

Then write the reversal conditions — the facts that, if different, would change the answer. This is
what makes a recommendation overturnable by evidence instead of by argument, and it is also the
honest record of what you were unsure about:

> この推奨は、`<前提>` が成り立つ限り。`<条件>` なら B が優位に転じる。

## Step 5 — Answer in this contract

Always this shape, in Japanese. Lead with the recommendation; the comparison is the support.

```markdown
## 問題
<何を決めようとしているか、1〜2 文>

## 前提
- <置いた仮定と、それが崩れたときの影響>

## 評価軸
- <軸> — <なぜこの問いでこの軸なのか>

## 選択肢
### <案の名前>
- 利点 / 欠点 / リスク / 既存構造との整合 / コスト

## 推奨
<どれを、なぜ>

## 推奨が変わる条件
- <この事実が違えば結論が変わる>

## 決めるべきこと
- <人間が決める事項> — 記録先: ADR / issue / spec のどれか

## 出典
- <発行主体> 「<資料名>」 <URL> （参照 <日付>）
```

When only part of the question could be researched, return that part and name the rest as
unresearched. A precise partial comparison beats a complete-looking one.

## Sources

Every external claim carries publisher, title, URL, and access date. Prefer primary and official
material — the project's own documentation, a specification, a release note — over secondary
summaries.

When lookup is unavailable, or a claim cannot be confirmed, **say it is unverified and lower the
confidence of anything resting on it**. Never produce a benchmark figure, a version number, a
deprecation date, or a citation you did not read. A fabricated source is not a small error here: it
is indistinguishable from a real one at the moment a decision is made, and it survives into the ADR.

For an in-repository claim, cite the path and the symbol, never a line number.

## Standalone by design

This skill produces `決めるべきこと` and stops. It does not adopt an option, write an ADR, file an
issue, or start implementing — and it does not invoke `new-issue` or `impl-issue` for you.

The gap between a recommendation and a decision is the whole point of the step. A recommendation that
flows straight into implementation was never reviewed by anyone; `AGENTS.md` puts architecture,
domain, and policy decisions behind a human gate precisely so that the option surviving to code is
one somebody chose. The route onward is human approval, then `new-issue`, then `impl-issue`.

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Establish the current state first; stop and ask for `repo-truth` when it is unclear.
- ✅ Report an existing ADR / spec decision as the answer when one already stands.
- ✅ Search `docs/adr/README.md` / `docs/design/README.md` by concern, never by the feature's words.
- ✅ Look for an isomorphic mechanism before treating the question as a design branch — by shape, by
  enumerating what a layer holds, not by grepping the concept.
- ✅ Traverse the graph for structural precedents and for blast radius, then confirm in source.
- ✅ Say which layers were enumerated before asserting no precedent exists; mark the options
  provisional when the sweep was partial or the graph was unavailable.
- ✅ Fix the evaluation axes before naming any option, and justify each axis.
- ✅ Weigh options for the `useTemplate`-time reader, not for this repository's history.
- ✅ State cost plainly, as information, alongside the recommendation.
- ✅ Give a recommendation with its basis, and the conditions that reverse it.
- ✅ Cite publisher, title, URL, and access date for every external claim.
- ✅ Answer in Japanese.
- ❌ Manufacture an option to reach a target count, or drop one that genuinely differs.
- ❌ Choose the axes after the preferred option is known.
- ❌ Let cost decide the recommendation.
- ❌ Invent a benchmark, a version, a date, or a citation; present an unverified claim as verified.
- ❌ Adopt an option, write an ADR, file an issue, or implement anything.
- ❌ Assert that no precedent exists off a keyword search, or off layers you did not enumerate.
- ❌ Re-open a settled decision on your own initiative.
- ❌ Chain into `repo-truth`, `new-issue`, or `impl-issue`.
