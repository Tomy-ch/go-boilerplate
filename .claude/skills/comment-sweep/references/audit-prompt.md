# Comment Sweep — auditor instructions

You audit the **existing comments** of one package on a single question: **is this content in the
right place?** You are read-only. Never edit, write, or mutate anything — the orchestrating
`comment-sweep` skill drives approval and performs every write.

## Read these first (single source of truth)

1. **Comment Rules in `docs/rules.md`** — what a comment may contain, and the jurisdiction clause.
   Apply it verbatim. If anything below disagrees with it, `docs/rules.md` wins.
2. **The *What belongs here* table in `docs/adr/README.md`** — decision / exclusion / rule /
   inventory and their homes. This governs where relocated prose may land.
3. **`docs/design/README.md`** — what a subsystem design reference is for.
4. **The nearest ancestor `README.md`** of the package you are auditing.

Do not rely on a remembered version of any of these.

## Your input

The orchestrator gives you a package directory and its resolved file list. Judge **every** comment in
those files, not only recently-changed ones — re-examining accumulated stock is the entire point.

## The question you are answering

Run **both passes** below over the same files. They find different things, and neither substitutes for
the other.

### Pass 1 — per comment: jurisdiction

For each comment, ask what `docs/rules.md` asks:

> If someone reversed this decision, which document would they be obliged to update?

Not "is this Why non-obvious?" — it usually is, and that question always resolves toward keeping,
which is exactly why the stock grew. The jurisdiction question is answerable from evidence, so it can
actually move a judgment.

### Pass 2 — per file: which single site owns this content

Then read each file's comments **as one body** and ask:

> Is this content already carried somewhere else in this file, and if so, which single site owns it?

Pass 1 cannot answer this, and not for lack of care. When one Why is written at three declarations,
each copy is non-obvious, each sits at the site whose premise it states, and each passes jurisdiction
on its own — three 維持. The redundancy exists only in the relation between them, so it is visible only
when the file is judged as a unit.

Three shapes qualify:

- **重複** — one Why restated at several declarations.
- **分散** — a constraint split so that no single place states it and a reader has to assemble it from
  pieces. The fix is to make one site whole, never to add another fragment.
- **総量過多** — each comment is individually correct, yet the file's total commentary costs more to
  read than the code it explains.

Run this pass on every file, including ones where Pass 1 found nothing: a file whose comments are all
individually fine is exactly where duplication hides.

## Verdicts

Return exactly one of five per finding.

- **維持** — the content belongs here. This is the correct answer for the ordinary case, and for
  anything whose constraint exists only at this call site: a `runtime.Caller` skip depth, an upstream
  bug workaround, a "do not reorder these two calls", a library's or SDK's specific behavior. Report
  these as a **count only**, with no per-item detail, unless the comment is wrong (see below).
- **短縮** — the content belongs here but is longer than the fact it delivers. Propose the compressed
  wording; never propose deletion under this verdict.
- **削除** — the comment carries nothing: pure restatement of the code, tautology, a resolved TODO,
  or narration of a mechanism the reader already knows. Quote the code that makes it redundant.
- **移設** — the content is real and worth keeping, but its jurisdiction is a document, not this
  declaration. Name the destination concretely and show the landing form (below).
- **集約** — the Pass 2 verdict, and the only one whose subject is a **set** of comments in one file
  rather than a single comment. One site keeps the content; the rest shrink to a pointer. It is one
  decision, not N: approving the shrinks without the surviving site loses the Why entirely, and
  approving the survivor without the shrinks changes nothing. Never split it into per-comment findings.

A comment that **contradicts the code** outranks all of this. Report it first, as its own finding,
regardless of jurisdiction — a doc comment that lies is worse than one in the wrong place.

The two passes must not report the same comment twice. When a comment is both individually shortenable
and a member of a 集約 set, the **集約 wins** and absorbs the shortening — the integrator would otherwise
ask the user about the same line under two verdicts that partly contradict each other.

## What a 移設 finding must contain

A relocation proposal that leaves any of these unanswered is not actionable, and an unactionable
finding wastes the reviewer's turn:

1. **Destination** — a specific file, and a specific section within it. Where an ADR is the
   destination, name the candidate ADR by number and title if one already covers the topic; if none
   does, say so plainly rather than inventing a number.
   - **Read the destination before proposing an addition.** It may already state the content — a
     package README's design-policy section is the usual case, and a comment restating it is exactly
     what this sweep is looking for. When it does, there is nothing to relocate: report `追記なし` and
     land the finding as a **短縮** to the residue plus a link. Proposing prose that duplicates what
     the destination already says corrupts the one document this skill is supposed to keep
     authoritative — a worse outcome than leaving the comment untouched.
2. **The prose to add** — the actual text, written to fit the destination document's voice; `追記なし`
   when the check above found it already there.
3. **The residue** — what stays in the code: the one or two sentences someone editing *this*
   declaration must not violate, plus a link. Write it out in full.
4. **The residue test** — confirm the residue still stands alone for a reader who does not follow the
   link. A residue that only makes sense after reading the destination has been cut too far.

## What a 集約 finding must contain

Everything here is what makes the set decidable as one unit. A 集約 missing any of it is not
reviewable, because the reviewer cannot see what they would be agreeing to:

1. **The shape** — 重複 / 分散 / 総量過多. These fail differently, so naming the shape is what tells the
   reviewer what to check.
2. **Every member** — each `path:line` and its comment in full. Not just the site you propose to keep:
   a consolidation cannot be judged from the winner alone.
3. **The owning site, with evidence** — which declaration keeps the content, and *why that one*. The
   test is ownership of the concept, not comment length or file order: the site a reader arrives at
   first when they ask the question the comment answers. State it, because a wrong pick is the
   expensive failure mode here — the other sites are already shrunk by the time it shows.
4. **The consolidated wording** — the full text the owning site will carry. It must cover what the
   shrunk sites gave up; a consolidation that quietly drops one member's distinct fact is a deletion
   wearing another verdict's name.
5. **Each pointer** — the exact residue left at every other site. A bare `// 詳細は上記参照` is not a
   pointer; name the declaration, so a reader who jumped straight to this line can navigate.
6. **確度: high / medium / low** — this one is load-bearing rather than decorative. The integrator
   applies a 集約 unattended only at `high`, so rate honestly: `high` means you could point to the
   sentences that are the same fact and to the declaration that owns the concept. Uncertainty about
   which site should win is `medium` at best.

A 集約 never writes to a document — it only moves content between comments inside one file. If the
right home turns out to be prose outside the code, that is a **移設**, and the two must not be mixed
in one finding.

**Do not consolidate into a package overview.** `// Package …` comments are out of scope in both
directions: not judged, and not a landing site. When the fragments really do add up to a package-level
statement, the verdict is 移設 to the package README.

## Destinations have entry bars — refuse the misroutes

Relocating is not dumping. A document that accepts everything answers nothing, and `docs/adr/` is the
one most at risk of becoming the default bucket, because from inside a comment nearly anything reads
as "design rationale". Refuse these two outright:

- **A library's or an API's specific behavior** — this driver returns X on Y, this SDK reads that env
  var. That is not a choice among alternatives; it is a property of the thing being called, and it
  changes when the dependency is upgraded. Verdict: **維持**.
- **Business / domain knowledge** — what a rule means, why a status transitions this way. Its home is
  `docs/spec/**`, never an ADR.

`docs/adr/` takes only a **choice among alternatives with lasting consequences** or a deliberate
exclusion. If a candidate fits no destination, that is evidence the code was the right place all
along — return **維持**. Proposing a bad destination is worse than proposing nothing: a wrong move is
far harder to undo than a comment left alone.

## Out of scope — do not flag

- **`// Name は、〜です。` field comments** — `// Limit は、取得件数の上限です。`,
  `// StatusCode は、HTTP ステータスコードです。`. These restate the identifier and carry little, but
  the repo deliberately keeps one line per field for visual uniformity and that call has been made.
  Do not flag them, do not propose deleting them, and do not raise it as a side note.
- **Functional / directive comments** — `//go:generate`, `//nolint:...`, `//go:build`, `//go:embed`,
  `// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT`, shebangs, SQL / YAML tool directives. Not prose; never touch.
- **Unresolved TODO / FIXME** — a legitimate marker whose code is not written yet.
- **Package overviews** — a `// Package …` comment, **wherever it lives**. This repository has no
  `doc.go` at all: every package overview sits at the top of an ordinary source file, so matching on
  the filename excludes nothing and flags every overview in the repo. Usage and How belong in an
  overview; `docs/rules.md` exempts them.
- **Generated files and `*_test.go`** — the orchestrator excludes them; if any reached you, skip them.

## Go exported-declaration caveat

`revive exported` requires a doc comment on exported Go declarations, in the leading-identifier form
(`// Foo は …`). For those, **削除 is not available** — the verdict is 短縮 or 移設 with a residue that
still opens with `// Foo は …`. Mark such findings explicitly so the apply step does not delete them.

## Output (Japanese)

Report only what you can quote from the code. Do not invent or pad — comment review over-flags
easily, and a padded finding costs the reviewer more than a missed one. If a package is clean, say so
plainly.

Your final message **is** the data the orchestrator consumes. No preamble.
